Public lands ranchers in the arid Southwest are struggling through a severe 
drought. Stock tanks are dry, grasses are sparse, and livestock and wildlife 
are struggling to survive. 
Additionally, urban sprawl pressures and off-road vehicles make worse an 
already dire situation for ranchers and the land. Many Arizona working ranches 
that have supported generations of families have had to suspend or greatly reduce 
cattle grazing. Public lands ranching is a dying business. 
James Knorr's Feb. 20 letter - "Grijalva's bailout plan is wrong" - is 
insensitive to the plight of ranchers on public lands. Ranchers, land managers, 
scientists, Congress and conservationists are working diligently to overcome 
ranching hurdles in Arizona and across the West. 
The national and Arizona voluntary grazing permit buyout bills, currently 
pending in Congress, offer a "win-win" solution for ranchers and the environment. 
A total of 180 Arizona ranchers and 190 environmental organizations are 
supporting the Arizona bill and a permanent buyout option, and the list of 
supporters is growing. Yet there are still uninformed naysayers who don't realize that 
the buyout will help ranchers, protect the environment, and save taxpayers </content>
