  <content>Concern for the welfare of dogs sold at auction is behind a call for 
legislative study that could bring new laws against animal abuse.
"I just think there ought to be some kind of standards and regulations if 
you're going to do this, to make sure that animals are humanely treated, make 
sure that they have adequate food and water and space," said Rep. Vaneta Becker, 
R-Evansville.
Her concern stems from a November dog auction in Odon, where irate dog lovers 
found abused animals in poor health.
When the legislature convenes Monday, Becker will ask for an inquiry into 
such auctions. If adopted, her resolution could lead to protective legislation in 
2005.
Animal advocates are grateful, but they fear the initiative won't go far in 
fighting abuse unless it extends to breeders who use the auctions to unload 
sick, surplus and problematic dogs on unwitting or uncaring buyers.</content>
