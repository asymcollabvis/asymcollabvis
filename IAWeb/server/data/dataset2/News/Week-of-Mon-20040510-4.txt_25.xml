TRENTON
A state senator from Burlington County jumped into the debate over mad cow
disease this week, introducing legislation that would have New Jersey
impose tougher rules on commercial animal feed than the federal government
does.

Under the terms of a bill introduced by Diane Allen, R-Edgewater Park,
"downer cows" could not be used in any commercial animal feed, not just
that fed to other cattle.

"Downer cows" are those too sick to walk.

Allen's initiative was prompted by allegations of a cluster of a rare
brain disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD, raised by a constituent,
Janet Skarbek of Cinnaminson.

Skarbek believes that an unusually high number of cases of CJD are
connected to eating tainted beef at the Garden State Racetrack.
