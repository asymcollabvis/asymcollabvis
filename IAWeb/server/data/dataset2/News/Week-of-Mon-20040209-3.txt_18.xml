Salt Spring's SPCA has put out a distress call to keep it from going under 
financially. 
The local society has now hit the wall after struggling for two years with 
changes imposed by the B.C. Gaming Commission CHECK NAME and the B.C. SPCA 
organization. 
"The idea of it closing is just heartbreaking," said Jena Peori, who has been 
both an SPCA volunteer and part-time employee. 
SPCA stalwart Cathie Newman said the problem first surfaced two years ago. 
"That?s the point we started using our reserves to help us . . . and then we 
were told [by SPCA head office] we couldn't use them anymore." 
Before 2002, Salt Spring?s SPCA applied for and usually received grants from 
the B.C. Gaming Commission, said Newman. Combined with islanders? donations 
and income generated from reserves, the SPCA could cover its costs. 
But gaming commission rules changed in 2002, so that only the head office of 
the SPCA could apply for a grant, which was capped at $250,000 ? about 
one-quarter of the total all branches received the year before.
The branch's 2003 deficit was forgiven by head office but the group was 
advised that would not be done again. 
"So this is why we have to raise the money on the island," said Newman.</content>
