Brian Weinstein isn't much of a cook: His only specialty, he says, is ragu 
sauce mixed with lean hamburger -- a topping he last whipped up for a 
spaghetti dinner served to his family a few days before Christmas.

But now the 49-year-old Mercer Island lawyer says he has sworn off making 
his specialty dish -- at least in its traditional incarnation.

He learned from local QFC officials that the ground beef he used for that 
spaghetti dinner 18 days ago was meat since linked to the slaughtered 
Holstein with the nation's only known case of mad cow disease. At 
Weinstein's request, store officials traced his purchase of that meat 
through his QFC Advantage Card.


Weinstein says he isn't one to get hysterical. He knows chances are slim 
that he, his wife or their children will contract variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
-- a disease that eats away at the brain. It has been diagnosed in only 
about 150 humans worldwide, likely caused from eating tainted beef.

Still, Weinstein now wonders and worries -- not for himself, but for the 
health of his two daughters, 9 and 12, and of his 14-year-old son.

"It's bad luck, really," Weinstein said yesterday. "It's like getting hit by 
lightning: There's one cow in the U.S. with mad cow, and my family probably 
ate it."

Officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department have repeatedly said the risk 
from eating muscle cuts from an infected cow -- the likely cut of meat that 
Weinstein's family ate in hamburger -- is extremely low.

Infected cows are known to harbor prions -- deformed proteins believed to 
cause mad cow disease -- mainly in brain and central nervous system tissue. 
Government scientists believe the only way cows get the disease is from 
eating feed mixed with such infected tissues.</content>
