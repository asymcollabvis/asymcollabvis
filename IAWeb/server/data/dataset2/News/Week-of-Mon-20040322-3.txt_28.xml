On March 22, 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin and Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Minister Bob Speller announced $995-million in assistance for Canadian farmers 
who face historic financial challenges brought on by circumstances beyond 
their control. This funding will also help producers? transition to new business 
risk management programming.
"The Canadian cattle and beef industry is a real success story, but it has 
been devastated by extended border closures, which are beyond its control," said 
Prime Minister Martin. "The government is providing the industry with this 
much needed assistance to help producers manage until borders are fully 
reopened."
"Farm income across Canada dropped to historic lows in 2003, affecting all 
commodities. Canadian farmers face these unprecedented challenges at the same 
time that they are moving to a new permanent income and disaster assistance 
program," said Minister Speller. "Today's funding will not only help our cattle 
producers through a difficult period but also the whole of the agriculture 
sector, which has weathered a number of shocks and unforeseen events in the last 
couple of years."
The Transitional Industry Support Program will provide a total of 
$680-million to cattle producers who have faced a prolonged closure of the Canada-U.S. 
border. The funding will be delivered as a direct payment of up to $80 per 
eligible bovine animal on inventory as of December 31, 2003. Eligible animals will 
include all bovine animals except mature bulls and cows (cows that have calved 
and intact bulls older than one year). Similar measures will be available for 
producers of other ruminants who have lost access to the U.S. market.</content>
