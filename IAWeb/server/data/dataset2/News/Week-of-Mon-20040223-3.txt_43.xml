  <content>Kim Shelton arrived at work at the Hoke County Animal Shelter 
earlier this month to find one of the dogs with its head stuck under a gap between 
the animal's chain-link cage and the concrete floor.
The dog wasn't hurt, but the incident is one of many that Shelton has had to 
contend with at the aging shelter.
The Hoke County Board of Commissioners toured the shelter during a special 
meeting Feb. 16 after learning about its needs from county Animal Control 
Officer Jimmy Carthens during a retreat Feb. 4.
Commissioners found leaking pipes, peeling paint, rusting cages, cracked 
Plexiglas windows and a roof that is not adequately insulated.
"Finally, we're getting some attention," Shelton said.
Shelton is the former president of the county humane society. She said she 
convinced the county 10 years ago to contract with the organization to operate 
the shelter after she witnessed abuses and poor conditions there.
The shelter is next to the county landfill on C.C. Steele Road. It was built 
around 1980 and includes 20 chain-link cages for dogs and two open rooms for 
cats. Shelton, with the help of a part-time employee and volunteers, has added 
dog runs behind the facility. The humane society purchased a washer, dryer and 
refrigerator for the shelter.
The shelter has also been affected by the county's growing residential 
population. More people means more animals, Shelton said.
More than 1,600 dogs and cats were brought to the shelter last year, Shelton 
said. Of those, about 400 animals were adopted and about 100 were returned to 
owners, she said. The rest were euthanized.</content>
