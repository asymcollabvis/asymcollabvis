The debate continues on whether the three dogs caught in the middle of the 
controversial trailside shooting case should be held as evidence at the 
Flagstaff dog pound or released to guardians while the case creeps its way through the 
justice system. 
Harold Fish, 57, has now been charged with second-degree murder for shooting 
43-year-old Payson Humane Society volunteer Grant Kuenzli. 
If Fish is indicted by a grand jury Thursday, the dogs could be locked up 
indefinitely while the case goes to trial.
Maggie, a yellow retriever-mix, Hank, a red chow-mix and Sheba, a 
brown-and-black shepherd-mix, have been in 4-by-6-foot kennels at the Flagstaff Humane 
Society since May 11 -- the night Fish shot and killed Kuenzli at a trailhead 
south of Clint's Well.
  
Fish said he was under attack by two of the dogs and then Kuenzli, who he 
said came running at him with a "crazed look in his eyes."
Fish fired a warning shot at the ground in front of the dogs and they 
dispersed. He then fired three rounds from his 10mm semi-automatic handgun into 
Kuenzli's chest.
Tom and Marilyn Iverson are looking for an attorney to represent the interest 
of the three dogs who could be euthanized because of Fish's allegations. The 
Iversons owned 30-pound Sheba for three years until their living situation 
changed and they were forced to give her up.
