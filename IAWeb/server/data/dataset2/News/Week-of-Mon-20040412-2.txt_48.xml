Warm sunshine, happy students, and good music: when all of these converge
with some well-cooked cheeseburgers and hot dogs, you have the newly
formed Meat Club.

The brainchild of Dan Holtzman ?06 and Doug Bernstein ?06, the Meat Club
intends to provide students with a social event on normally quiet, lazy
Sunday afternoons. Holtzman had been in a meat club in high school and
always barbecued with friends in college. He and Bernstein had the idea to
expand their private gatherings to an event open to the entire campus as a
way to both meet new people and get the school to pay for their food. 
...
However, the path was not yet clear. Some vegetarians and vegans were
offended by the slogans on some of the club?s posters. Of particular
concern was the phrase, ?Vegetables are condiments. Eat meat.? The poster
also contained an image indicating disfavor towards broccoli. Vegetarian
Gustavo Maximo ?07 said that because of the advertisements, ?I thought the
club would be more actively anti-vegetarian.? Holtzman even received an
angry e-mail from one vegan student.

Holtzman wishes to dispel these myths. ?We are not forcing [the meat] on
anyone,? he claims. He personally does not support the idea of
vegetarianism, but respects people?s right to that lifestyle. ?In my
opinion,? he says, ?vegetarians are only living half a life. We?re simply
providing the other half.? </content>
