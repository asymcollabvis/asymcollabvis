For the past two decades, Charles Blair and his wife, Jane, have come to
the Cole Brothers Circus' stop in Annapolis to witness a tradition as old
as the circus itself: elephants raising the big top.

Yesterday morning, however, the couple - in their 80s - watched in
confusion as dozens of workers lifted the colossal red tent above the
dusty circus grounds at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium.

"I even brought peanuts for the elephants," said Charles Blair, pulling a
brown paper bag out of his pocket. "But someone just told us that there
aren't any this year."

Faced with dwindling audiences, sliding profits and increased pressure
from animal rights organizations, traveling circuses, including Cole
Brothers, New York's Big Apple Circus and Missouri's Circus Flora, have
sent their elephants into early retirement - canning one of the most
costly acts for such shows to maintain.

"In the next 10 years, we think even zoos may no longer have elephants,"
said Bob Johnson, president and chief executive officer of the Outdoor
Amusement Business Association, which represents more than 4,000 circuses,
carnivals and other acts in the United States and Canada. "I'm as
disappointed as the little kids who come out to see them."
