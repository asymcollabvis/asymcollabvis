They burned a mountaintop restaurant in Vail. They released mink from a
farm in Pennsylvania. They defaced SUVs in Richmond.

And now, members of the Earth Liberation Front-- ELF-- have taken aim at a
controversial shopping center site in Charlottesville.

Developer Wendell Wood knew there was opposition to his Hollymead Town
Center project. And he'd heard of the group that vandalized 30 SUVs in
Richmond.

But he didn't think opponents of Target's future home would go so far as
to torch two trucks and a piece of heavy equipment on the Rt. 29 site of
his Town Center, and leave a banner boasting, "Your construction =
long-term destruction-- ELF." 
...
The FBI puts ELF at the top of its list of domestic terrorists, and
categorizes its followers as "special interest terrorists," much like the
Animal Liberation Front. The Charlottesville attack has been turned over
to the FBI.
...
Wood calls himself an environmentalist-- "believe it or not"-- and asks,
"This is the sort of person who represents me?"

The sabotage will not slow the completion of Hollymead Town Center, he
says. Rain has been more of a problem for the approximately $400 million
project, but the Target and other stores are still scheduled to open in
the spring of 2005.

"Obviously" says Wood, he wishes he'd already put a guard on the 163-acre
property. "There will be now. If they come out there again, they better
have a bulletproof vest." </content>
