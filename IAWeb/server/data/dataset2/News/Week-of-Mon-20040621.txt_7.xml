You can drink at the Red Brick Saloon, snack on "angel flake donuts" and
eat at the Station 49 Diner if you visit the Sierra foothills town of
San Andreas. Or go 2,282 miles east to Hohenwald, Tenn., to buy a
tractor, see the Lewis County Museum of Natural History and sell your
scrap at a downtown pawn shop.

If you're an elephant, just head straight for the local sanctuary: San
Andreas and Hohenwald are pachyderm paradises. And one of these days,
San Francisco Zoo residents Lulu and Tinkerbelle will be packing their
trunks and moving to either Calaveras County or Tennessee.

Carol Buckley, a former exotic animal trainer who runs the Elephant
Sanctuary in Hohenwald, said she tells new arrivals one thing: "We are
here to serve you. We don't want to control you."

Hohenwald and San Andreas are among the few places on Earth where
elephants have nothing to worry about: no chains, bullhooks, concrete
floors, beatings, shrinking habitats, ivory poachers or ennui.
