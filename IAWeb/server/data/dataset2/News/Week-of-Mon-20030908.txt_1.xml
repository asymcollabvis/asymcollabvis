  SCIENTISTS HIGHLIGHT FISH 'INTELLIGENCE'

  Fish are socially intelligent creatures who do not deserve their
reputation
  as the dim-wits of the animal kingdom, according to a group of leading
  scientists.
 
  Scientists say fish do not deserve their "dim-witted" reputation
  Rather than simply being instinct-driven, the group says fish are 
cunning,
  manipulative and even cultured.
 
  The three experts from the universities of Edinburgh, St Andrews and 
Leeds
  said there had been huge changes in science's understanding of the
  psychological and mental abilities of fish in the last few years.
 
  Writing in the journal Fish and Fisheries, biologists Calum Brown, Keven
  Laland and Jens Krause said fish were now seen as highly intelligent
  creatures.
 
  They said: "Gone (or at least obsolete) is the image of fish as drudging
and
  dim-witted pea-brains, driven largely by 'instinct',' with what little
  behavioural flexibility they possess being severely hampered by an
infamous
  'three-second memory'.

  "Now, fish are regarded as steeped in social intelligence, pursuing
  Machiavellian strategies of manipulation, punishment and reconciliation,
  exhibiting stable cultural traditions, and co-operating to inspect
predators
  and catch food."
