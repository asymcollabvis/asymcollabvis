A poodle mix sits in her cage at the Russellville Animal Shelter. Dozens of 
dogs and cats are available for adoption, and a new spay-and-neuter program at 
the shelter has reduced the costs associated with pet adoption.
New program saves furry lives, officials say


A new spay-and-neuter program at the Russellville Animal Shelter is saving 
more lives of its furry residents, according to city animal control officials 
and department statistical reports. 
The program, implemented this summer, led to a significant drop in the 
euthanization of cats and dogs, Russellville Animal Control Director Mike Vernon 
said. The new program is the city?s proactive attempt toward controlling the 
community?s pet overpopulation problem, he said. 
?We?ve seen a reduction in the number of animals we?ve had to put to sleep, 
and that?s a trend we like to see,? said Vernon, who is in his 17th year at 
the shelter. ?We?re serious about controlling the pet population, and we 
appreciate the support we?ve received from many of the veterinarians in our 
community. We couldn?t do it without them.? 
Participating veterinarians from Russellville and Dardanelle spay and neuter 
adaptable shelter animals for a reduced charge for the city, meaning the 
animals are already spayed and neutered when they are adopted from the shelter. 
Previously, cats and dogs would be adopted as-is, and animal control officials 
would not know if pet owners ever had their new pets spayed or neutered.
