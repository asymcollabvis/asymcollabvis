GRAND JUNCTION - Hunters took their best shots at Colorado wildlife 
commissioners Thursday in a battle with two contentious fronts: the right of residents 
versus nonresidents to pursue big game, and the decision to provide a limited 
versus unlimited number of hunting licenses.
"We are very concerned about losing jobs and the impact this will have on the 
state's economy," Randy Horne of the Northwest Colorado Outfitters 
Association told members of the Colorado Wildlife Commission.
Horne spoke during public testimony regarding policies that include limiting 
the number of elk hunters so more trophy-sized bull elk can grow in Colorado's 
game management units.
"What is a trophy?" Horne asked rhetorically. "A trophy is in the eye of the 
beholder. If we only manage for numbers and inches, I have to ask the trophy 
hunters, 'Where does it end?'"
Montrose hunter Roy Misenar disagreed with the economic argument for 
providing extensive big-game hunting licenses.
"We put a dollar sign on these animals," Misenar said. "People say, 'It's 
going to hurt my business (if the state reduces hunting license numbers), 
therefore.' Therefore what? These animals don't owe anybody a living."
