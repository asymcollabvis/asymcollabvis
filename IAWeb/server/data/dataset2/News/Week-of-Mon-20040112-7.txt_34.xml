Nonresident elk hunters spent nearly $20 million dollars in southwest Montana 
in 2002, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to 
the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.

"That's the direct expenditures, for things like gas, food, lodging, 
outfitter fees," said Rob Brooks, director of FWP's responsive management unit in 
Helena. "It does not include license fees or durable goods -- guns, packs, those 
kinds of things."
And it doesn't include the so-called multiplier effect, the idea that money 
ripples through the economy, being spent several times and widely boosting 
prosperity.

"A hunter spends a dollar down there at Bob Ward's in Bozeman, that pays for 
lights, salaries," Brooks said. "The salaries, those employees go out and 
spend that money again.

"It's about two to three times depending on the industry," Brooks said, so 
the hunter spending could mean a $40- to $50-million boost for the economy in 
places like Ennis, Bozeman and Gardiner.</content>
