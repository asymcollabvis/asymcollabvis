LIVERMORE -- Local residents looking to experience the Big Top in a big
way, can attend Circus Chimera's 2004 tour next week in Livermore.

The show, titled "Wonders of the World," features Superclown, a comic
superhero seeking to save the world from gloom with his only power --
the ability to make people laugh.

Don't look for any tigers, or elephants, though: Circus Chimera doesn't
use animal acts.

An unusual mix of acrobatics and aerial artistry, the event combines
extraordinary human feats, yet focuses on theatrical expression. 
...
"We don't have any animal acts, which means we have a lot of support
from animal rights groups," he said. "This is our first trip we've taken
to the Tri-Valley area, and we're looking to provide a great show for
everyone."
