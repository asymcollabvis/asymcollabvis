  <content>A group opposed to government efforts to manage bison 
wandering from Yellowstone National Park has accused federal, state and county 
officials of a concerted effort to undermine its work by repeatedly violating 
members' constitutional rights. 
In a federal lawsuit filed in Missoula, the Buffalo Field Campaign claimed 
authorities engaged in "an escalating and systematic pattern and practice of 
assaults, harassment, spying, intimidation, slander, false arrest and 
detentions." 
The alleged actions of officers working for the U.S. Forest Service, Montana 
Department of Livestock and Gallatin County sheriff's office occurred without 
legal justification, the complaint said. 
Lorette Ray, spokeswoman for Gallatin National Forest; Karen Cooper, public 
information officer for the state livestock agency; and Marty Lambert, Gallatin 
County attorney, declined to comment Monday. All said they had not yet seen 
the suit, which was filed March 3. 
The complaint, which is before U.S. Magistrate Leif Erickson, asks for a 
total of $950,000 in damages from various individuals and the county, in addition 
to attorney fees. 
The suits lists 16 alleged incidents, with most of the confrontations between 
officers and group members occurring during 2001 and 2002. The events 
involved times when members were watching and sometimes videotaping government agents 
hazing, capturing or shipping to slaughter bison that migrate from the park 
in search of winter forage. </content>
