Pulaski Police Officer Tim Wroda said he intends to find out who put three
Australian Shepherd puppies, ropes tied tightly around their necks, inside
a plastic garbage bag and left them to die at a remote dumpster on the
campus of Martin Methodist College.

One of the puppies, a female, survived, but her two brothers died of
suffocation. A student found the bag and carried the dogs to the Giles
County Animal Hospital and Donna Dixon, president of Adoptable Angels, a
non-profit group that helps abandoned animals.
