Niki and Tyler, both 11, look unfazed as they wait for their test results. 
They rest on blankets in the cool, clean outpatient chemotherapy ward, their 
clear blue eyes alert but calm. Niki had surgery to remove a malignant tumor and 
is here so doctors can determine what further care is necessary. Tyler has a 
chronic cough and an enlarged spleen. The pair traveled three hours to the 
University to be examined.

Niki and Tyler are Siberian huskies, and their owner, Denise Vasquez, brings 
them to the University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) even though she is 
a practicing veterinarian in Arlington Heights, Ill. 

"I like to bring them back here to get checked out," Vasquez said. 

She said she takes a whole day off work to bring Niki and Tyler to Urbana 
because of their veterinarians' certification and the fact that her dogs' records 
are at the VTH.

The VTH treats 19,000 client-owned animals at the facility on the southeast 
side of campus each year. More than 12,000 of these are pets, but veterinarians 
also treat horses and livestock through farm visits and injured wildlife 
brought to the Wildlife Medical Clinic. The VTH has one of only three veterinary 
diagnostic laboratories in the state of Illinois, according to the VTH Web 
site. Veterinarians practice internal medicine and perform surgery, and the VTH 
has specialties in fields such as ophthalmology, dermatology and oncology.
