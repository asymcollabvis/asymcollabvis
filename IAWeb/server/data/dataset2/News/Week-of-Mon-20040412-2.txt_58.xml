  <content>Proposed rules giving ranchers far more flexibility to kill 
problem wolves still don't go far enough, angry ranchers and landowners told 
federal officials here Thursday night.

Although new rules under consideration would let ranchers kill any wolf 
spotted near livestock, several people said that wasn't enough. And several 
ranchers said the federal government should start killing wolves because the 
predators are overpopulated and constantly attacking livestock.


 

"The landowners need to be able to kill a wolf whenever they see it," 
Paradise Valley rancher and outfitter Randy Petrich said.

A standing-room-only crowd of more than 50 people packed the meeting at the 
city-county building, which was put on by Montana Sen. Conrad Burns. Ed Bangs, 
wolf recovery leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was joined by 
Clint Riley, special assistant to the director of the service.

A Park County sheriff's deputy sat off to the side of the room, a testament 
to the chilly atmosphere toward federal officials. Bangs was called a liar 
several times, and Lenny Gregorey, a former Livingston city commissioner, called 
Bangs "Frankenstein" and said he had "screwed" all the ranchers in the room.</content>
