It?s a problem that?s long dogged garden-loving pet owners. How do you 
manage to maintain prized plants and a beloved pooch without either harming the 
other? 
It?s a balance Theresa Ink has yet to achieve. 
The founder of Affordable Spay/Neuter in North Fort Myers is a confirmed pet 
lover. She?s also passionate about her gardens. 
Last year, she spent a considerable amount of time and money landscaping much 
of her 1?-acre property in south Fort Myers. DOGGIE DO'S &amp; DONT'S
Do: 
? Leave a couple of feet unplanted near fences, to which dogs are naturally 
attracted. 
? Keep compost piles someplace pets cannot get to. 
? Consider creating container gardens or using raised beds, both of which 
discourage digging. 
? Provide an area in which dogs may dig and praise them when they use that 
space. 
? Adjust your expectations. There will be some yellow areas in the lawn and 
the occasional foray into the garden no matter how much you try to prevent them.
 
? Be extra careful with water gardens or ponds. Pets are curious and might 
fall in. Either place a fence around it or make sure there are steps or a 
shallow area that make it easier for the animal to get out. 
Don?t: 
? Punish a pet for misbehavior unless you catch it in the act. 
? Weed in view of a dog. Weeding creates new scents that dogs find 
irresistible. 
? Install new plants in the presence of a dog. Seeing you digging is apt to 
inspire it to do the same.</content>
