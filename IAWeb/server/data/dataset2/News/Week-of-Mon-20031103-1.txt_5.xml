On most evenings this fall, when Bonnie McElrath and her 8-year-old 
daughter, Kylie, fed their horses boarded in a Coker Butte pasture, they 
were visited by 50 of the biggest and most majestic creatures Oregon’s woods 
have to offer.

McElrath’s horses shared the pasture with a herd of Roosevelt elk that has 
graced rural ranches and pear orchards along Medford city limits for the 
past 20 years.

Protected and coddled by landowners between Highway 62 and Foothill Road, 
the normally wary elk paid little mind to the McElraths as they sat 
spellbound, soaking in the elk’s grunts and smells, something most 
Oregonians never experience.

"We’d sit there and it was just incredible how the elk would mill round us, 
and there’s no way I’d do anything to bother them," McElrath says. "There’s 
an unwritten rule among everyone here that you leave that herd alone."

But there are no written rules that the herd is off-limits to sport hunting. 
And when two of the elk, including a large six-point bull that was their 
leader, were shot legally by two hunters during the recent elk season, the 
incident incensed people such as McElrath who view those elk more like 
neighbors than wild animals.

"That herd, basically, belongs to everyone in this valley," McElrath says. 
"I think it’s disgusting. I can’t even tell my daughter what happened. It 
would devastate her."

As cities continue to creep toward Oregon’s wildlands, big-game hunting 
within the shadows of urban areas is becoming a hot issue along both ends of 
Interstate 5.

Shooting guns within city limits is illegal in Oregon, but cases like 
Medford’s elk and a similar incident involving a black-tailed deer near 
Portland have created a call for extending the no-hunting zones out to 
cities’ urban growth boundaries.
