Curtis Cloutier runs what you might think of as a halfway house for dogs. 
It's not that the dogs who wind up in his temporary care are coming out of 
prison or anything like that, but being retired racing greyhounds fresh off the 
track, they're used to a regimented life with lots of rules and regulations. 

 


Dinner comes at a certain time, they get out of their kennels to exercise at 
a certain time, lights out comes at a certain time. And the distractions that 
fill a pet dog's day - cats, chew toys, mail carriers - well, there ARE no 
such distractions at the track. Track life is very no-nonsense. 
Yet these dogs may be no more than 3 to 5 years old. They still can have a 
long career as a pet ahead of them, but they've got to put their old life behind 
them first. </content>
