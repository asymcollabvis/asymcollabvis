Three teenagers are accused of putting a pet goose and a blind duck in a
portable toilet and setting it on fire, killing the animals.

Authorities also have linked the three to eight other fires during the
last two months in Fort Myers Shores, including one at a business that
caused $200,000 in damage, according to the State Fire Marshal?s office.

Two 15-year-olds and one 13-year-old face charges of arson, cruelty to
animals, grand theft and criminal mischief, the fire marshal?s office
said. The Lee County Sheriff?s Office could not confirm the arrest of the
13-year-old. The News-Press is not naming them because of their ages.
