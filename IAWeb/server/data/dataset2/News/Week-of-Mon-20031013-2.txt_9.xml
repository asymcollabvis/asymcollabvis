 The redhead walking by let him know that there were others like him.

"It's OK," she said, leaving the kitchen after rinsing her dish. "I eat fish."

Still, Matt Bornstein-Grove, 20, was the only poultry- and red-meat eater
at the Tacoma Veggies potluck last month. He had come with other
University of Puget Sound students because he was thinking of converting,
and now he was surrounded by nearly 25 people, mostly vegans who regard
animal and animal-tested products as murderous or abusive.

It isn't that he disagrees with their convictions.

"It's just laziness on my part," he said. "I feel like if I'm going to do
it, I have to become committed on all fronts - become more aware of how
things are made, buy from responsible companies."

It's a tall order. Veganism, the strictest vegetarian lifestyle, eschews
not only meat, fish and dairy but also gelatin, cashmere, glycerin, honey,
keratin and wax. Veganism means no leather boots, no gummy bears, no
Tylenol Gelcaps.

The vegans at this potluck dinner drew the line at microbes, which meant
they weren't opposed to drinking beer. But the drinks for this mostly
underaged crew were Silk soymilk and Silk chocolate soymilk. And the
atmosphere inside the house near Sixth Avenue was granola, bare feet
outnumbering lipsticked lips.</content>
