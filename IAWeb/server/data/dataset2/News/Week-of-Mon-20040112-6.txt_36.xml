  <content> Christina Haire and her family, who were burned out of their 
Effort home in December, have disappeared like smoke, according to Stacy Keeney 
of Creature Comforts in Saylorsburg. 
Creature Comforts, a veterinary clinic, took in the Haire family's three pit 
bulls on Dec. 10. The family was staying at the Pocono View Inn in Sciota 
after their home burned to the ground.
Haire, her husband George, and son William Harris, 15, watched their home of 
a year and half burn.
Various community agencies and individuals assisted the Haires with food, 
clothing, and shelter. Creature Comforts, though it had no previous relationship 
with the family, took in the dogs.
Now, Creature Comforts wants to know if they want two of the dogs back.
"At this point, they seem to have abandoned their dogs here," Keeney said.
Keeney said that the family showed interest in the well-being of the dogs and 
even came and picked up the oldest of the three dogs, Lukie, on Jan. 5. 
"They called and checked on these animals," Keeney said.</content>
