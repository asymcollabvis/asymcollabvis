The circus is coming to town. Please consider this before taking your
family to the circus:

Training methods are often abusive, cruel and stressful. Circus trainers
use whips, tight collars, electric prods, bullhooks, and other tools to
break animals? spirits and teach submission. In fact, The ASPCA, the Fund
for Animals and the Animal Welfare Institute brought a lawsuit against
Ringling Bros. under the Endangered Species Act for its mistreatment of
elephants. Earlier this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected
Ringling's arguments that the case should be thrown out, and the case will
go forward in federal district court in Washington, D.C.
