The Marion County Sheriff's Department also launched an internal 
investigation over the animal-neglect allegations against Deputy Karen Bumgart, RTV6's 
Jack Rinehart reported Tuesday. 

Animal control officers say Bumgart abandoned the cats and didn't leave 
behind food or water for them when she moved out of the west-side apartment. The 
apartment's managers summoned the officers after Bumgart left. 
"These animals cannot feed themselves -- you have to give them food to take 
care of them," animal control Sgt. Jerry Bippus said. "They can't open a fridge 
or cabinets to get food. These animals were left there to fend for 
themselves." 
Officers let RTV6 see the apartment Tuesday. Clothes, boxes and trash were 
strewn throughout the unit. 
Also left in the unit were parts of Bumgart's uniform, including pants, a hat 
and the back side of a bulletproof vest. </content>
