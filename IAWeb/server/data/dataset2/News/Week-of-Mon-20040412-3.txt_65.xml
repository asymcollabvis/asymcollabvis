Flint -- If you pass up a fast food hamburger, the processing energy you
save would equal about 20 miles worth of fuel for a car and water for 17
showers, environmentalists say.

Raising animals for food requires more than one-third of all raw materials
and fossil fuels used in the United States, say animal rights activists.

That's one of the reasons Meriam Corcoran has been a vegan, a vegetarian
who uses no products derived from animals, for 13 years.

Corcoran is a founding member of Veggies In Motion, a metro Detroit group
seeking to spread news about the benefits of plant-based nutrition.
