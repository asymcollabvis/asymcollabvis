The first head-to-head trial of four popular diet plans -- Atkins, Dean
Ornish, Weight Watchers and the Zone -- has found that people who stick
with any of them for a year lose about 5 percent of their body weight, far
fewer pounds than most dieters hope for. At least a third of the dieters
in the four plans drop out before the year is up.
...
About half of those in both the Atkins group (very low carbohydrate, high
fat) and the Ornish group (very low fat, high carbohydrate vegetarian)
dropped out before the study was completed. About a third dropped out of
the Weight Watchers group (low fat, moderate calorie, similar to the diet
advocated by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines) and the Zone (which relies on a
system to track how much food raises blood sugar levels). "The more
extreme diets like Atkins and Ornish were tougher to follow than the Zone
and Weight Watchers," said Michael Dansinger, the lead author of the study.

All four groups showed about 3 percent weight loss overall over the year
-- equivalent to a 200-pound person trimming about six pounds. But among
those who stuck with their diets for the entire year, results were
slightly better, ranging from a 4 percent loss for Atkins to 6 percent for
the Ornish group. Both the Weight Watchers and the Zone dieters lost about
5 percent.
