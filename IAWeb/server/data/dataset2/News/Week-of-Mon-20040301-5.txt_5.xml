Local entrepreneur enjoys success with her own line of pet food 
A healthy dog is a happy dog. Just ask Linda Murdock, a local entrepreneur 
who created a recipe of dog food good enough for human consumption. 
Putting her money where her mouth is, Murdock broke a dog biscuit in half, 
took a bite from one half and said, "Here, try one," as she handed an 
unsuspecting reporter the other half. 
"All the ingredients are natural," Murdock said, offering a piece to the 
deliveryman, who politely declined, his facial expression making clear that he 
thought eating dog food was nuts. 
Murdock's company, Happy Dog, creates products that contain a nutritionally 
balanced blend of human-grade ingredients of the highest quality vegetables, 
whole grains, herbs and vitamin supplements. 
Soon after she began feeding her own dogs such nutritional products in the 
late 1980s, friends began asking Murdock to make them a batch of dog food. 
"Our food bill for two people was $400 a week because I was feeding many dogs 
in the neighborhood," she said. "Then my husband said I had to recoup what it 
cost me." 
However, it was not until 1997 that Murdock decided to go into business for 
herself. 
On a trip to Kansas City, the couple went to a mall, where they discovered 
the Three Dog Bakery chain, which features products for dogs such as a chocolate 
cake made from pur?ed liver. </content>
