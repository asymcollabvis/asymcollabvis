This year's Liberation carnival committee has backed away from its plan to 
offer nightly cockfighting at the carnival after Gov. Felix Camacho strongly 
opposed it. 



Gov. Felix Camacho's opposition has ended plans to offer cockfighting as a 
nightly feature at this year's Liberation carnival. 
Camacho is firmly opposed to cockfighting at this year's carnival, said the 
governor's spokesman, Shawn Gumataotao. 
Liberation Day Organizational Committee Chairman Tony Lamorena had said 
Tuesday that cockfighting and betting would be allowed in a closed-off area where 
only adults could enter. The carnival opens June 18 at Paseo in Hag?t?a. 
Lamorena acknowledged yesterday that the governor has the final say. 
"He does not approve of any heavy-duty gambling," Lamorena said.
