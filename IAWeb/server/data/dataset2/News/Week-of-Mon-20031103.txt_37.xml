  <content>Analyzes McDonald's 
policy requiring its meat suppliers to limit use of antibiotics in meat 
production
New report examines industry implications of policy announced by one of 
world's largest meat purchasers
Bio Economic Research Associates, or bio-era(TM) (http://www.bio-era.net/), a 
leading independent research and advisory firm providing analysis on the 
future of the global bio economy, today announced the release of its latest 
research report entitled "McDonald's Global Policy on Antibiotic Use in Meat Supply: 
Implications for Food and Agriculture Supply Chains."
The report offers industry-wide, strategic analysis of McDonald's 
Corporation's policy announced in June 2003, which requires its direct suppliers of meat 
to phase out the use of certain antibiotics for animal growth promotion. The 
report analyzes new and strategic questions for companies in the food and 
agriculture value chain arising from the new McDonald's policy.
The report also explores the scientific and economic issues associated with 
antibiotic and synthetically-produced antimicrobial use in beef production, 
describing how and why these control agents are used, the effects, the health 
risks, and the possible strategic implications of initiatives by large buyers 
and/or by regulators to restrict the use of antibiotics for animal growth 
promotion.
