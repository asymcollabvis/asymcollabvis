  <content>A broad array of U.S. environmental and health advocates have 
deplored President George W. Bush's failure to even mention a series of 
critical global issues in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. 
In a flurry of statements issued Wednesday, groups ranging from the League of 
Conservation Voters (LCV) to Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) expressed 
concern that Bush's omissions signaled the loss of interest in environmental 
degradation and the global AIDS crisis. 
Green groups suggested that Bush's failure to even mention the 
environment--despite new reports released by high-level U.S. scientific groups over the past 
year expressing increasing certainty that the burning of oil and other fossil 
fuels is responsible for global warming--was a deliberate attempt to take the 
issue off the political agenda in the November elections. 
"The fact that President Bush avoided mentioning his administration's 
environmental policies could be seen as a tacit admission that his record is 
deplorable and the issue is a vulnerable one for him," according to a statement issued 
by the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) here. 
It noted that Bush had nothing to say about policies he had previously 
trumpeted as major advances for the environment, including his "Healthy Forests" 
initiative, which allows loggers to cut down large, fire-resistant trees in 
remote areas, or his "Clear Skies" initiative which, if approved by Congress would 
allow power plants to defer improvements designed to reduce air pollution for 
a longer period than under current law. Both initiatives have been strongly 
opposed by environmental groups. </content>
