Controversial cultural event will benefit Portuguese religious organization 
in Salinas

It's either a cruel example of "ritualized mock violence" or a celebration of 
a great cultural heritage.
However it's described, a bloodless bullfight is scheduled for the Salinas 
Sports Complex next month, the first such production in Monterey County.
Sports Complex officials say they expect a big crowd for the June 13 event, a 
benefit for a Portuguese religious organization.
"For years, people have been asking about bullfights," said Sally Hamana, 
spokeswoman for the California Rodeo, which operates the Sports Complex. "There 
is a lot of pageantry involved. It's very festive and very fun."
That's not how Gary Tiscornia would describe it. He is executive director of 
the Monterey County SPCA.
"If you look at it, it's ritualized mock violence that can only be done here 
in California under the aegis of a religious organization," Tiscornia said. 
"We believe in celebrating the multiculturally rich society. But traditions 
change with the times. A bloodless bullfight is not worthy of today's moral 
considerations."
Traditional bullfighting -- the ones that ultimately result in the death of 
bulls -- are illegal in the United States, though the sport remains popular in 
other countries, including Mexico, Portugal and Spain.
Even the bloodless bullfights were not allowed in California until state law 
was changed recently. The law allows bloodless bullfights as long as they are 
staged in conjunction with a religious celebration.
The matadors and bandarilheiros do not use sharp blades during the bloodless 
bullfights, instead employing blunted velcro-covered instruments.
