 on Wednesday sued animal-rights 
activists who have targeted the company, asking a judge to order a halt to actions 
that have "moved from harassment and intimidation to full-blown terrorism." 
The lawsuit claims that after months of making threatening phone calls and 
visits to employees' homes, vandalizing employees' private property, and so 
forth, Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA (SHAC USA) had a hand in last August's 
bombing of Chiron's headquarters. 
"On information and belief, Chiron alleges that the FBI has linked the person 
suspected of carrying out the bombings, a man named Daniel Andres [sic-- San 
Diego, toSHAC USA's president, Kevin Jonas," the lawsuit says. 
FBI Special Agent LaRae Quy wouldn't comment Wednesday other than to note, 
"We only have charges pending against Mr. San Diego and not against anybody 
else," although "we do feel he's had support." 
Officials in October named Daniel Andreas San Diego, 26, of Sonoma, as a 
suspect in the Chiron bombing as well as in the September bombing of Shaklee Corp. 
in Pleasanton. Nobody was hurt in either explosion. San Diego remains a 
fugitive, considered armed and dangerous, with a reward of $50,000 offered for 
information leading to his arrest. 
SHAC USA spokeswoman Alex Bailey characterized Chiron's complaint as a "SLAPP 
suit," a strategic lawsuit against public participation aimed at limiting 
SHAC's First Amendment rights. 
"If the Chiron suit looks anything like the other 12 SLAPP suits we've come 
up against, it's an entire lawsuit based on a guilt-by-association theory that 
doesn't square with the Constitution," she said. "Never once has there been 
any judgment against us, and we don't expect there to be one in this case </content>
