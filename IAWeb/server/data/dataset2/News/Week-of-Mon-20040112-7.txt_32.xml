Playhouse on the Square is looking for a dog with a bit of the Bard in his 
bark. 
The theater is casting a canine in its production of "The Wizard of Oz." 
The dog needs to be 15 pounds or less; easy to tote! It needs to be unafraid 
of a crowd, easygoing around people, respond to basic commands and, most 
important, follow Dorothy, preferably without a leash. 
"We're having an open casting call," said Courtney Oliver, public relations 
manager for the theater. "Acting experience isn't necessary." 
But it would help. 
Nothing can steal the spotlight faster than a willful animal or small child 
who ventures off on a tangent. 
Oliver said resumes and photographs aren't necessary unless pet owners want 
to present one to amuse the theater staff. 
The original Toto was played in the classic 1939 movie by a Cairn terrier 
named Terry. Terry appeared in 11 movies, usually cast as an unnamed character 
with the credit "dog." </content>
