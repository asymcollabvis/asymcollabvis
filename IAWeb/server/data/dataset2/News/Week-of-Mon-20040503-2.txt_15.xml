OPINION -- Exposing environmental programs usually brings an attack from
the green direction. Their usual tactic is to intimidate and belittle the
writer. Greens hate for the general public to know their real agenda -
which is to control all property - on land and water.
...
Trent Loos of Faces of Agriculture, doesn't let the environmentalists stop
him, he says "bring 'em on." Loos exposes PETA, Sierra Club and other
environmental organizations and how they affect agriculture. In a recent
article by Loos, he spoke about organizations who use Farm Aid money to
sue farmers.

"Farm Aid's website includes photos and statements from Farm Sanctuary, a
group that promotes a vegan and vegetarian lifestyle. Farm Sanctuary put
the only two pig farmers in Florida out of business by promoting a law
that bans individual animal housing units for sows. They are currently
supporting legislation in New Jersey and California to put more family
farms out of business," reported Loos.
...
Loos says "To top it off, Country Music Television (CMT) recently ran a
Farm Aid documentary. Listed in the credits was none other than "Voice for
Animals," an animal rights group who's main goal is animal liberation."
