  <content>GOING by first impressions, the two women appear to have nothing in common. 
The American is a diplomat's wife, a stately lady who doesn't own a single pair 
of jeans. An interior designer by profession, the Filipina is also a seasoned 
mountain climber and a self-described "extreme person." Yet when Renee Speltz 
and Vivian de Veyra met through a common friend in November 2002, it was as 
if they had known each other all their lives, and then some. 

"If we believed in reincarnation, we would have probably lived years ago in 
the same place," suggests Speltz, better half of United States Ambassador and 
executive director to Asian Development Bank Paul Speltz. "We just clicked," 
says de Veyra who claps her hand for emphasis. "Suddenly the person who 
introduced us said, 'What's happening? You're speaking the same language!'" 

 
That language is dog. Speltz, a dog lover since her youth, was in the market 
for a labrador, which de Veyra breeds (along with rottweilers and beagles). 
Although Speltz would end up acquiring her chocolate lab Tex from someone else, 
the meeting with De Veyra forged a genuine friendship and a life-saving 
organization like no other. 

Called the Philippine Canine Search and Rescue Association, Inc. (PHK9SAR), 
the non-stock, non-profit organization's mission is threefold: to educate 
Filipinos on what dogs can do in the face of calamities; to train volunteers (that 
is, handlers and dogs) to be effective search and rescue teams; and to serve 
Filipinos caught in life-and-death disasters, both natural and man-made.</content>
