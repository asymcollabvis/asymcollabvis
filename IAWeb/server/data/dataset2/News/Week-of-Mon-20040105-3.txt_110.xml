  <content>The Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office will decide whether 
two cable-television installers accused of tying a cat to the bumper of an 
Ocean Cable Co. truck and dragging it through the streets will face felony charges.
An arraignment scheduled yesterday in Atlantic City Municipal Court for one 
of the suspects, Joseph M. Newton, 25, of Galloway Township, was postponed 
pending the prosecutor's review. Newton is charged with animal cruelty.
An Atlantic City police sergeant allegedly noticed a cable-company truck 
dragging the animal Dec. 22 as another cable truck followed along Grammercy Avenue 
near Route 30.
Newton, who was driving the second vehicle, has pleaded not guilty, said his 
attorney, Jerry H. Steiner of Pleasantville.
The driver of the vehicle that allegedly dragged the cat, Robert Hewitt Jr., 
28, of Egg Harbor Township, waived arraignment and asked for a trial date to 
be set, according to a court official. Hewitt is charged with animal cruelty 
and inhumane treatment of an animal.
The municipal charges would amount to nothing more than disorderly person 
violations, which usually carry the penalty of a moderate fine.
But if the Prosecutor's Office decides there is sufficient evidence for 
felony animal cruelty charges in Superior Court, the men could face up to 18 months 
in prison and fines of $10,000.
