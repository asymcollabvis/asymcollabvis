Colin Lowry, cell biologist and Associate Editor of 21st Century Science &amp;
Technology magazine, was interviewed on Feb. 12 on the danger of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy?BSE, or mad cow disease?and the little-known
science of prions. The interview, excerpted here, was conducted by
Economics Editor Marcia Merry Baker and Science Editor Marjorie Mazel
Hecht. The full interview will appear in 21st Century Science and Technology.

EIR: We have had two cases of BSE in North America over the past nine
months, and from a scientific point of view, you have said that the
Federal food and agriculture safety policy is outrageous. What is the danger?

Lowry: The Federal standards are totally inadequate. There's very little
testing at all to identify cows that are slaughtered that might have BSE.
There is absolutely no testing before an animal is slaughtered, which is a
real problem, because if you find a BSE cow, you can't identify where it
came from. And the only way to find new cases is to catch them at
slaughter by chance.
...
EIR: And then you also had big funding of the effort of the so-called
friends-of-the-animals, to say, that prion disease is "revenge" on
meat-eaters.... In Britain, they just cancelled the building of a new
research lab, because of the animal rights people protesting, that they
didn't want testing on animals. And yet, who is going to get hurt from this?

Lowry: The first casualty of prion diseases are animals.;</content>
