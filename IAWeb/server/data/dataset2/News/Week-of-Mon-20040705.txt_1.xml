Lost Acres has been giving neglected horses a home for 10 years  
Sissy Burggraf sat on the porch of her country home, pulling out photo albums 
 filled to the brim with pictures of her "patients."  
As she flipped through the photographs of lanky horses with abscesses, open  
sores and contorted legs, Burggraf couldn't help but fight back tears.  
"It's hard to believe someone could abuse an animal to the point of deforming 
 their body," she said. "People just don't care."  
After working for a local veterinarian who treated cases of animal abuse,  
Burggraf, of Ross County, started a nonprofit organization to help save the  
lives of mistreated horses.  
"I decided I'd try to help a small portion of the horse world," she said. "I  
try to keep them from going to slaughter, getting abandoned, abused, 
neglected  and severely injured."  
Celebrating its 10th anniversary today, Lost Acres Horse Rescue and  
Rehabilitation started with just one horse.  
Today, more than two dozen roam the stables on Charleston Pike.  
From champion show and racehorses to Arabians and thoroughbreds, they've all  
found a home at Lost Acres.  
Burggraf recalled the case of an 11-year-old horse which, upon arriving at  
Lost Acres, knew nothing but beatings his entire life.  
"He didn't know there was a caring person out there until he came here," she  
said.  
Among those Burggraf has rescued are Ginger, found by a stranger lying in a  
ditch, a mother and son equine duo locked in a barn for 28 years, and a host 
of  blind horses saved from needless euthanasia.  
Burggraf was nominated as the Special Recognition Hero for her work with  
horses last November at the first Heroes Breakfast hosted by the American Red  
Cross.
