We've found the perfect ailment for the age of George W. Bush: bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy, better known as Mad Cow Disease. 
The actual number of humans who suffer from the human variant of Mad Cow 
Disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, is, as of now, statistically small, but you would not 
know that from the media's fascinated fixation on it as a vehicle of hysteria 
(read: ratings boost, distraction from dead Americans in Iraq). 
Thus I ask readers to think of Mad Cow Disease as a metaphor for the Bush 
era. Consider the following: the brain of Mad Cow victims is turned into mush, 
rendering them incapable of even eating a pretzel without coming to harm. The 
incubation period for the disease in humans can be as long as 30 years; thus, we 
won't know the extent of the damage that has been that has been done until 
far into the future. The cause of the disease getting into the food supply is 
lax enforcement of an agency due to pressure from corporations that donate money 
in order to thwart regulations. And -- the real Bush signature -- the current 
crisis was avoidable had public health been a priority and voices of experts 
including a Nobel Prize winner (Stanley Pruisner) six months ago, been heeded</content>
