  <content>Lee Boyd Malvo was the spotter -- not the shooter -- 
in all but one of last year's sniper killings, Malvo told a psychologist, 
contradicting the confession he gave to police. 

Malvo blamed himself for the arrest of sniper mastermind John Allen Muhammad, 
and felt compelled to take the blame for the sniper rampage, psychologist 
Dewey Cornell testified Monday at Malvo's trial. 

Malvo's confession -- in which he claimed he was the shooter in all of last 
year's sniper shootings in metropolitan Washington that left 10 dead -- was "an 
attempt to sacrifice himself and claim credit to spare Mr. Muhammad,'' said 
Cornell, of the University of Virginia. 

"He felt responsible for their being caught by falling asleep, and he blamed 
himself for the failure of their mission,'' Cornell said. Malvo and Muhammad 
were arrested while sleeping in a car at a highway rest stop in Maryland. 

Malvo is presenting an insanity defense to capital murder charges in the Oct. 
14, 2002, slaying of FBI analyst Linda Franklin outside a Home Depot. The 
defense claims he was brainwashed by Muhammad and could no longer tell right from 
wrong. 

Cornell said that after Malvo had been indoctrinated by Muhammad, "he 
believed what he was doing was right and that John Muhammad was a chosen person of 
Allah.'' 

Cornell diagnosed Malvo with a dissociative disorder, a form of mental 
illness in which a person loses touch with reality and his own identity becomes 
distorted. Cornell gave no opinion on whether the mental disease rose to the level 
of insanity. 

"This was a very unusual, rare case,'' he said.
