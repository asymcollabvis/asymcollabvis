 Pet owners are happier than their non-pet owning counterparts according to 
new research from the not-for-profit mutual friendly society, Benenden 
Healthcare. The research which polled people in the UK, revealed that over half (55%) 
of pet owners are happy and that 71% do not feel stressed, in comparison to 
45% and 29% of non pet owners. 

The survey, which questioned respondents on a number of themes relating to 
pet ownership and wellbeing, also looked at whether owning a pet should be 
encouraged. Two thirds of respondents felt that it should be, with just 32% 
thinking that perhaps we are better off without animal companionship. 

The view of over half the people questioned (56%) was that pets are most 
beneficial for people over 50 that are heading towards retirement. Although many 
felt that animals can be of more benefit to the younger generation with 37% 
stating that children can profit most from owning a pet. 

Furthermore the survey results suggest that possessing a pet later in life 
can help to reduce loneliness in old age - over 97% of respondents were in 
agreement with this. However, in contrast, only 38% believed that owning a pet 
would speed up a person's recovery if they were ill. But when this percentage was 
split between the pet-owners and non pet owners, 77% of those in agreement 
owned animals. </content>
