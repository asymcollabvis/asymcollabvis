  <content>The new residences of the extremely 
endangered Chinese Tigers have been finally unveiled after two years' scientific 
inspection and research. 
    Zixi County in east China's Jiangxi Province and Liuyang City of central 
China's Hunan Province were selected by International Federation for Salvage 
of Chinese Tigers (SCT) as the experimental habitats for the rare animal 
species. 
    Quan Li, a Britain-born-Chinese, who is the founder of SCT, says this 
signifies China has taken a crucial step in saving Chinese Tigers. 
    The Chinese Tiger, from which other sub-species such as the Siberian 
Tiger evolved, is a critically endangered tiger sub-species native to south China. 
    Today, fewer than 30 Chinese Tigers remain in the wild while about 60 are 
kept in zoos. The total number of Chinese Tigers is even less than that of 
pandas and it is listed as one of the world's ten most endangered animals. 
    "Chinese Tigers prefer to live on the even grasslands, yet theyare forced 
to migrate into forests when their habitats were taken for industrial or 
agricultural uses and that is why they are on the verge of extinction now," says 
Quan.
