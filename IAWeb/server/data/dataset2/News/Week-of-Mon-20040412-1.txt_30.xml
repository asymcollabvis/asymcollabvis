A potential settlement in a legal battle over foie gras production could
mean some trespassing allegations are dropped from a suit against animal
rights activists who say the delicacy is made by torturing ducks, one of
the defendants said Tuesday.

In return, the activists would drop the owner of Sonoma Foie Gras and his
wife as defendants in a separate animal cruelty suit.

No settlement has been reached, and attorneys on either side of the
dueling lawsuits -- which have pitted vegan activists against Sonoma
restaurateur Guillermo Gonzalez, who runs one of two foie gras farms in
the country -- would say little, citing the ongoing discussions.

But Bryan Pease, one of several activists who have acknowledged repeatedly
breaking into Gonzalez's Sonoma Foie Gras' farm in San Joaquin County last
year, said the settlement would mean the trespass allegations against him
and his co-defendants would be dropped.</content>
