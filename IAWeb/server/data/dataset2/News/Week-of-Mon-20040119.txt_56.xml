A recent census of the Virunga Volcanoes mountain gorilla 
population has found that the great apes have increased their numbers by 17 percent, 
according to conservation authorities in Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and other groups. 
The results indicate a total of 380 gorillas, up from 324 individuals in 1989, 
the last time conditions were stable enough to conduct such a census. 
Facing the threats of sporadic insecurity and poaching, the mountain gorillas 
of the Virungas have climbed back from a low of approximately 260 individuals 
in 1978, when many believed the mountain gorilla would become extinct. When
considered against the backdrop of regional instability during the past 
decade, the increase seems even more encouraging for conservationists.</content>
