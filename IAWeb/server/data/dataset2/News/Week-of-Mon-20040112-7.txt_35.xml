  <content>Fiona, the last wolf at the Canadian Centre for Wolf Research, 
has died - but decades of intriguing research into these often misunderstood 
animals will live on. 
"She died in her favourite spot in her favourite bit of woods," said Jenny 
Ryon, who worked at the centre for nearly 30 years and who fed the wolves daily. 
Ms. Ryon discovered the 11-year-old wolf's death on Dec. 22. 
While not a secret, the passing of an era was marked quietly during the past 
few weeks by animal lovers who raised money and cared for the wolves. 
"I took the time to grieve privately," Ms. Ryon said Saturday in a telephone 
interview from her Shubenacadie home. 
"Fiona was elderly for a wolf, so this wasn't anything we didn't expect," she 
said. </content>
