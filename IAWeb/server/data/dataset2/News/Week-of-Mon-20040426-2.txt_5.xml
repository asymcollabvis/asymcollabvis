Our pets are important to us all. They are considered family members. We
treat them like brothers and sisters. We spend millions per year on
medicines, food, toys and ugly clothing-like items. Heck, there's even a
couple of TV stations devoted to pets.

It's not surprising that those emotions can easily extend to other animals.

But, sometimes that emotion goes a tad too far.

Found in the Mailbox this week: A report from Philadelphia's City Paper
(not the hallowed Inquirer; this paper is named (City Paper) about a
bizarre kidnapping case. Missing: 48 animals from a high school.
...
The Mailbox wonders if such animal rights groups keep their targets set
high on big businesses for reasons other than the ethical treatment of
animals.

Groups like PETA, and the unnamed kidnapping group, could do so much more
good for their causes by helping out their local, no-kill shelters.
