North America?s first case of mad-cow disease in a decade ? in a
single cow in Alberta ? inspired Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien to carve a juicy steak in front of TV cameras last month to
reassure the public and resuscitate the $22 billion beef trade
between the United States and Canada.

Yet many diners wonder: Is beef safe to eat?

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy has not been found in any U.S. beef
products. But Canada sends 1.7 million cattle south every year. Until
an import ban May 20 when the disease was discovered, processors
regularly mixed beef from both nations ? and others. 
...
But consumer advocates say Canada?s lone mad-cow case is a sentinel,
not an aberration. "The fact that [mad-cow] hasn?t been found here
doesn?t mean it isn?t here," said CSPI?s DeWaal. "It?s very likely
we?ll see a case or more of mad-cow disease here."
...
Because of its age, however, the infected Canadian cow could have
eaten tainted food before the ban. It took nearly four months to test
the Alberta cow. During that period, the cow was rendered and made
into food for chickens and dogs. Dogs and poultry can?t contract the
disease, but inspectors can?t prove that prion-laden feed didn?t
inadvertently contaminate feed meant for cattle.

And poultry may act as a reservoir for the disease. If chickens
picked up prions in their feed and were themselves processed into
cattle feed, it may perpetuate the outbreak in future herds, some
speculate.

Also questionable are blood and other protein materials used in
dozens of supplements, including weaning products for calves, Hansen
said.

A third potential loophole is cattle identification. The infected cow
in Alberta belonged to at least four herds. Investigators, slowed by
incomplete records, are still tracing its origins, offspring and
herdmates.
