Last year, more than 750,000 people joined or renewed their membership in
the Sierra Club, presumably because they believe in its historic mission
to protect America's public lands and wilderness for future generations.
John Muir and a small band of conservationists founded the club in 1892,
and it's been working for more than a century to protect our nation's wild
lands, wildlife, air and water.

But recent events now threaten to divert the Sierra Club from its mission.
In early January, 13 past presidents of the club wrote to its current
board of directors to express "extreme concern for the continuing
viability of the club." They warned of an "organized effort" to take over
the board of the Sierra Club in order to move personal agendas "and to use
the funds and other resources of the club to those ends." Those agendas
are narrow, focusing on animal rights and anti-immigration policies.

In a speech to the 2003 Animal Rights Conference in Los Angeles, newly
elected Sierra Club board member Paul Watson boasted: "We're only three
directors away from controlling that board. We control one-third of it
right now. And once we get three more directors elected ... we can use the
resources of the $95 million-a-year budget to address some of these
issues. ... So, you know, a few hundred or a few thousand people from the
animal- rights movement joining the Sierra Club - and making it a point to
vote - will change the entire agenda of that organization."
...
The Sierra Club is an environmental organization. It is not an
animal-rights organization. As for immigration, the club's membership has
already voted to stay out of the immigration wars.</content>
