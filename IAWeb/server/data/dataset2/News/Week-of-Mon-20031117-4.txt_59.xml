Federal agents show up at Jello Biafra speech, arrest student in
connection with false testimony
...
Chico State senior Harjit Gill said his cell phone rang near the beginning
of Jello Biafra's show in Bell Memorial Union Auditorium on Wednesday
night. It was FBI Agent Chad Coulter and he had a warrant for Gill's arrest.

Gill said he told Coulter, "I'm not running from you. Come get me." Then
he informed Coulter of his location.

Coulter, along with another FBI agent and a University police officer,
arrested Gill during Biafra's performance on one count of giving false
testimony to a grand jury and two counts of lying to a federal officer.
All three counts are considered perjury. 
...
The charges are related to a Grand Jury investigation in July concerning
the Animal Liberation Front. Gill said he was brought in because he is a
political activist.

"I'm not linked in any way to the Animal Liberation Front other than the
fact that I'm in philosophical agreement with it," he said. "I'm not a
participant in any way."

FBI Special Agent Karen Ernst said Gill was arrested based on a criminal
complaint of giving a false declaration to a Grand Jury. 
...
Gill also said that he never had his rights read to him and that he spent
six hours in a holding cell in the basement of the Sacramento County
Courthouse. He said he told guards that he was a vegetarian and lactose
intolerant, but nobody seemed to listen.

"I was given a bologna sandwich three times," he said. "I was also given a
packet of Kool-Aid without a cup or water. I guess I was just expected to
savor the flavor of cherry in my mouth for a while."
