The epochal success of South Korean researchers in cloning a human embryo and 
culling stem cells from it is likely to influence discussion in Japan about 
such studies. 

'It's an achievement that provides great hope for patients suffering from 
serious diseases,' said Shinichi Nishikawa, group director of the Laboratory for 
Stem Cell Biology at the government-affiliated Institute of Physical and 
Chemical Research (Riken)(Japan). 

The experiment by scientists at Seoul National University involved a special 
technique to remove the nucleus of an egg taken from a woman and replace it 
with the nucleus from one of her own cells, thus creating genetically identical 
cells. 

The technique may provide a breakthrough in transplant treatment because a 
patient's body would not reject cloned cells. Transplanting cloned nerve cells 
containing a patients' own genes could cure Parkinson's disease or spinal cord 
damage caused by damage to nerve cells. 
But some observers have voiced ethical concerns over cloning, warning that 
cloned embryos could result in a human clone if they were placed in a womb and, 
even if cloned embryonic stem cells were used exclusively for the purpose of 
studies and medical treatment, the embryos themselves from which human life 
starts would be artificially created and destroyed. </content>
