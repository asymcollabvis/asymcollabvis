Utah's legacy of activism in the name of earth, plants and animals
reaches back to the earliest days of Edward Abbey's lament against the
construction of roads in the desert and Sierra Club leader David
Brower's fight to stop dams on the Colorado, Yampa and Green rivers.

Those were gentler days.

Beginning in the 1990s, animal rights extremists in Utah began releasing
hundreds of penned creatures in the dead of night and tossing pipe bombs
and Molotov cocktails. These domestic terrorists are part of a
multi-national movement advocating a violent revolution to stop animal
testing, sprawl and deforestation.

While most environmental and animal activists are peaceful, the ELF, and
its sister group the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), have convinced a
steady stream of young Utahns that letter writing and picketing aren't
enough.

"They transition to a higher level of violence in order to achieve their
objectives," said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Ray Mey, who has watched
the rhetoric grow more dangerous.
