Cougars chewing at economy

Cougars have killed so many Rocky Mountain elk in Wallowa County 
that only 360 tags for antlerless elk are being offered to hunters this 
year, down from 4,140 just eight years ago.

Because hunting is big business in northeast Oregon, the economic impact 
quickly trickles down to the county's 7,140 residents. The sharp decline 
also could signal bad news for people beyond Wallowa County.

State Fish and Wildlife Department biologists say heavy cougar predation of 
elk calves will continue and is likely to have a similar effect in Union, 
Baker, Umatilla and Grant counties.

During elk season, hunters used to overwhelm the cafes, gas stations and 
grocery stores of Wallowa County, said 73-year-old Ken Spidell of Lostine. 
People joked that a traffic signal had to change in Portland before you 
could make a left turn in Enterprise.

"Now you can't tell hunting season is here," said Rob Lamb, 55, a Joseph 
businessman and flyfishing outfitter who has lived in the county 25 years.

The county's 19 outfitter and guide operations have been especially hard 
hit.

A decade ago, 30 to 40 clients of the Eagle Cap Wilderness Pack Station at 
Wallowa Lake paid $1,000 each for a deluxe, five-day December antlerless elk 
hunt
