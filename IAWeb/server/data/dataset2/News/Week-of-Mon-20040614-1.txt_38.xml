Three Knoxville sisters made an upsetting discovery on Tuesday night at
their abandoned family farm off of Old Callahan Drive in North
Knoxville.

Someone has been using the sheds on the farm to keep a flock of
roosters, and according to animal welfare officials, there are strong
indications the fowl were used for the illegal sport of cock fighting.

"It was very upsetting, very. This is my momma and daddy's home," says
property owner Donna Smith.

Clues that the animals may have been used for fighting include missing
feathers and crowns. While no fighting devices -- like razor blades --
were found, some of the roosters' spurs have been trimmed - a hint that
blades could be attached for fighting.
