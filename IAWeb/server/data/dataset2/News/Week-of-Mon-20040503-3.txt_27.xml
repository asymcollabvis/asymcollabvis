Michael Moore is making headlines with his controversial documentary, but
one group is targeting the filmmaker for his waistline.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has selected the gadfly
filmmaker as one of its ?Flab Five? and is treating him to a Veg Eye for
the Fat Guy makeover. ?Looks like the ?Downsize This? author has been
doing too much supersizing,? notes PETA.

?We?ll be sending him a nice little care package, a makeover kit filled
with health and diet tips, PETA?s vegetarian starter kit, and suggestions
on how he might change his lifestyle,? PETA?s Michael McGraw tells The Scoop.
