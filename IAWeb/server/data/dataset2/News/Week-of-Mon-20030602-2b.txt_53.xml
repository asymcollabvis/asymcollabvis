Portions have grown so slowly that you may not have noticed.

When Baby Boomers were babies, food servings were ample. Not
enormous, but more than enough. This is back when a majority of
Americans did not weigh way too much.

Families started to eat at restaurants more often, and fast food
became a family staple. Somewhere along the way, normal meals gave
way to stomach-stretching excess. 
...
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, meanwhile, says
that it has undertaken a study of two diets: a normal
don?t-stuff-yourself-with-doughnuts diet and an animal-free vegan
diet.

Since we already know people in the United States are consuming too
many calories and not exercising enough and high levels of
cholesterol are unhealthy, the aim of the PCRM study is obscure.

It would be shock if the vegan diet doesn?t come out ahead. The PCRM
has two additional studies under way. One seeks an answer to the
question "Can a vegan diet cure diabetes?" and the other is delving
into whether a vegan diet can relieve premenstrual syndrome.

The physicians are also extremely concerned about the use of animals
in research. While its Web site has a paragraph or two about diet, it
has 14 fact sheets decrying research conducted with animals.

The Center for Consumer Freedom sneers at the Physicians for Social
Responsibility. The CCF suggests that the PCRM is heavily funded by
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA.
