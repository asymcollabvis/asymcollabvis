Urban Texans own a lot of rural Texas. And they are buying more. 
When a piece of rural land is sold in Texas these days, the buyer is almost a 
cinch to be an urban or suburban resident purchasing the tract for what can 
be generalized as "recreational" purposes. 
The buyer doesn't plan to put the land into agriculture or livestock 
production, as it probably previously had been used. Instead, the land will be used as 
a retreat, a place to hunt or fish or a "country place" to which the owner 
can temporarily escape or move to at retirement. 
This new group of rural landowners often has little or no experience with 
managing land and lacks the knowledge necessary to make the property as 
productive for wild things as they almost all want them to be. 
Many, if not most, of these landowners would jump at the chance to learn how 
to best handle their land and take full advantage of opportunities to improve 
them. 
This change in rural land ownership has not escaped state and federal natural 
resource agencies or private conservation organizations. They know the future 
of wildlife and healthy natural landscapes depend on these new owners of 
rural land being given the tools to best care for their new responsibility. 
"Giving people the information they need -- the basics of how to manage their 
land for wildlife -- is something we realize there's a big need for," said 
Diana Foss, a Houston-based urban wildlife biologist for the Texas Parks and 
Wildlife Department. </content>
