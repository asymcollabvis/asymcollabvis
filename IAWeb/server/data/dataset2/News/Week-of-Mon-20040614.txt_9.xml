Oregon?s 2004 big-game auction and raffle hunts have raised almost $370,000 
for programs to improve conditions for critters and to promote hunter access, 
officials with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said.

Drawings were held May 22 for raffles involving hunting tags for four deer, 
four elk, one combination deer and elk, one pronghorn antelope, one Rocky 
Mountain goat and one bighorn sheep hunt.

Names were pulled out of the drum during a banquet at the Oregon Hunters 
Association convention in Portland.

Money raised from both the raffles and the auctions goes into the state?s 
Access and Habitat Program. Money from the fund is parceled out for projects 
throughout the state.

The last of the auction tags also was sold at the association convention.

Others had gone on the blocks earlier in the year at a variety of banquets 
held by various hunter organizations, including the convention.
