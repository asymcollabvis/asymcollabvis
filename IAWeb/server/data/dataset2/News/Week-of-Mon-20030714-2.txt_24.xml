There are many consequences to the massive scale of our food production,
distribution, marketing, and consumption. While we may celebrate its
?convenience? or laude the ?freedom of choice? it seems to provide, in
reality its convenience masks disturbing inefficiencies, unsustainable
extractive practices, and terrible injustices in distribution. The
apparent abundance masks a basic orthodoxy in the way our food is grown,
processed, and marketed. ?Freedom of choice? really is not what it seems,
since in fact we obtain most of our food within a narrowly defined system
of capitalist production, underwritten by government subsidy at all levels
from the point of production (price controls, fallow payments,
environmental clean-up of toxins, wars to protect fuel inputs, and laws
that favor large-scale farms at the expense of family farms and
smallholding) to the point of consumption (food stamps, laws that favor
corporate supermarkets). We have many ?choices? within one basic food
system, rather than many choices within a heterogeneous food system.
