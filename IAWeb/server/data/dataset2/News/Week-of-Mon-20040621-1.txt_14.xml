WASHINGTON - Food and consumer groups handed mediocre grades to the
Agriculture Department in a "report card" Tuesday on its handling of mad
cow disease.

Groups such as Center for Food Safety, Consumers Union and the
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Foundation gave no "A's" and only one "B" -
for a new policy prohibiting non-ambulatory animals from use in food and
feed - out of 10 categories. There was one "C" for initial steps to
better identify and track cattle nationally.

Six "D's" were given in the areas of: testing cattle 20 months or older;
ensuring feed restrictions; increasing surveillance for variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad cow disease;
strengthening authority to recall tainted meat; implementing use of
country of origin labels; and allowing for public input.

The groups, which also included Friends of the Earth, Government
Accountability Project, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy
Action and Public Citizen, said the administration deserved two failing
grades.
