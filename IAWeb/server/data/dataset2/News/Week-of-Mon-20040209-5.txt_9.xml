If you recognize the cat in these pictures from somewhere other than Milford 
Humane Society, then you should probably be ashamed of yourself. 

     That likely makes you the person who threw her and another beautiful cat 
out during the coldest week of the year. Ironically, this person would barely 
have had time to recycle the Milford Daily News that contained an article 
outlining the dangers of frostbite for animals before throwing the cats out. 

     The cat, a gorgeous calico now called Dayna, was abandoned with an older 
kitten, probably her son from a previous litter. Eventually, they made their 
way into the basement of an apartment building but not before her ears froze. 

     Frostbite is a pretty horrible experience for both people and animals. 
Most people have seen a picture somewhere of people who's skin turns black from 
frostbite and that's pretty much what happened to Dayna's ears. The top half 
turned black as if it had been burnt, then it crumpled like paper. I think 
(and hope) that once it turns black, there's no feeling in it. But once the ends 
of the ears actually fall off, it leaves a raw edge that has to start healing 
all over again. That, I suspect, must hurt. 

     To add insult to injury, she had never been spayed either and gave birth 
to three kittens in the cold. Although somebody did care enough to call the 
shelter, the little ones were too vulnerable in the frigid weather and they had 
already died before Dayna got to Milford Humane. </content>
