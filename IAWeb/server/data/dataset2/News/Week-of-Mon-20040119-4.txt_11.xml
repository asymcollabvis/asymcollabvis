In the wake of the discovery of BSE, the United States Department of 
Agriculture has been told to speed up the implementation of a national animal 
identification scheme.

US Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman has told Congress that developing a 
verifiable system, to trace animals from paddock to plate, is a top priority.

While welcoming the scheme, Kendal Frazier from the National Cattlemans Beef 
Association in the US, says there are questions about the cost of 
implementation.

"We have a hundred million head of cattle in the United States; in the life 
of an animal in the United States they change ownership three or four times. We 
have 800,000 producers or premises where cattle are raised. So it's a very 
complicated picture, and we have some questions about it; but we support the 
general concept of it." 

And it appears Australia may have to follow the US lead, and fully implement 
a national ID scheme.

Manager of Australia's NLIS Mick Prendergast says the US beef industry will 
have to accept individual animal identification, after disputing the move for 
decades.

And Mr Prendergast says in order for Australia to continue exporting beef to 
the US, stringent new rules will have to be met. </content>
