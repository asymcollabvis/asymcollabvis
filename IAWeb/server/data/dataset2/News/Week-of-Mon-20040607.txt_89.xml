With almost a quarter of Britons who claim to be vegetarian admitting to
regularly eating red meat, are entirely meat-free diets on the wane?

One in five so-called vegetarians admitted eating poultry and over half
ate fish, research by the TNS Family Food Panel found on Tuesday.

The survey found just 42% of people who professed to be vegetarians
adhered to the traditional definition, eating no red meat, fish or
poultry.

British Dietetic Association spokesman Sue Baic said the "vegetarians"
eating some meat and fish were likely to be those who had chosen the diet
for health reasons.

"People following a vegetarian diet for ethical reasons, I doubt they
would include those foods," she said.

Vegetarian Society chief executive Tina Fox said the TNS survey
highlighted a general increase in the number of people eating some meat
and fish as part an increasingly vegetarian diet - a portion of whom
would call themselves vegetarian.

Veggie future

"There has been a big rise in the number of 'meat reducers'. The
vegetarian food market continues to increase," she said.

"Food issues are much higher up the agenda and people are getting more
health-conscious. They are more concerned about their food, more
concerned about how things are reared. People are buying organic produce.
People are more concerned about what they put in their mouths."

TNS found 4% of Britons said they were vegetarians - a figure that has
remained static in recent years - but Ms Fox said she was optimistic
about Britain's "meat reducers".
