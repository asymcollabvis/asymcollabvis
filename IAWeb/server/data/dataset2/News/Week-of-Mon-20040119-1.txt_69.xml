The Public Health Ministry yesterday warned people against eating raw or 
semicooked eggs in any form for fear of contracting diseases that have killed 
almost a million chickens since November. 
Meanwhile, Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan insisted that the 
chicken deaths were not caused by the birdflu virus and that initial tests had 
indicated a chicken butcher in Nakhon Sawan had contracted a bacterial infection, 
and not birdflu, as suggested by a senator from the central province. 
Sudarat said the Cabinet wanted her ministry to protect people from being 
infected by the cholera and bronchitis outbreak by refraining from eating 
semiboiled eggs, fried eggs with raw yokes, or ice cream topped with raw egg yoke. 
She said the Agriculture Ministry had also been ordered to ensure that no 
chicken meat from diseasehit areas was released on the market. 
Sudarat said the Public Health Ministry had been closely monitoring the 
symptoms of the hospitalised chicken butcher from the beginning, but had not made 
any announcement on the case because it was still awaiting final confirmation 
on the cause of his illness. She said results from laboratory tests would be 
released in two or three days, confirming whether he had bird flu or not.</content>
