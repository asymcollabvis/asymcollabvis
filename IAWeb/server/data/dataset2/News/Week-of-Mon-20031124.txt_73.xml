Monitoring increases
Costly tests follow spread of chronic wasting disease in Western deer and 
elk


From staff and wire reports


Millions of dollars are being spent for increased testing to monitor the 
occurrence of chronic wasting disease in deer and elk throughout much of the 
nation.

Chronic wasting disease is a neurological disorder that causes deer and elk 
to become weak, wobbly and eventually die. The disease is related to the 
sheep disease scrapie and to mad cow disease, but so far there is no 
evidence it can spread to humans.

The disease has been documented in southeast Wyoming and northeast Colorado 
over the past few decades. In recent years the disease has been spreading, 
as far east as Minnesota and as far west as Colorado's Western Slope.

In Wisconsin, where there are two secular religions -- hunting and the Green 
Bay Packers -- deer hunting is so ingrained in the culture that schools 
close during peak season.

But last year hunting dipped by 10 percent in the Badger State. George 
Meyer, executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, said some 
hunters were fearful of contracting CWD, even though it's never been found 
to cross the species barrier.

As CWD draws closer to Idaho's borders, experts worry it's just a matter of 
time before Idaho deer and elk populations contract it. Although no Idaho 
animals have tested positive yet, infected wild animals have been found in 
some neighboring states.
