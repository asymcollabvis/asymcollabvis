Dyed monkeys in a zoo of Shengyang, North China's Liaoning Province. 
(sina/file)
    And wouldn't you just know that someone, somewhere would take this 
wonderful concept from the Chinese zodiac - and all the spirit of fun it typically 
engenders - and try to ruin it for everybody. 
    Take the case of the rainbow monkeys of the Forest Safari Park in 
Shenyang in Northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
    There, a safari park has already put a stain on the year-long 
festivities. At least for me. 
    Someone on the park staff, for some still undetermined boneheaded reason, 
decided to dye all of the park's monkeys various colours of the rainbow. 
    Embarrassed as they were, the monkeys at the park are now being crudely 
shown off - their fur, in some cases, bright red, gold, and, we suppose, green 
and purple. 
    Yes, folks, they park staff has made monkeys out of its monkeys. 
    In fact, a park worker was stupid enough to admit the monkeys knew enough 
not to go along with this harebrained plan. He told a reporter from the 
Xinhua News Agency that - the mammals who are closest to us in intelligence - were 
anything but co-operative when they tried to dolly up their coiffures.</content>
