I read through the Jan. 8 edition of The Muse, and came across the opinion
piece about the virtue of soy. I have several vegan/vegetarian/dabbler
friends who raise many of these points and who argue with some of my more
carnivorous friends about this subject.

At first, I thought it was a lovely rebuttal to some points I've heard
before, even though I never read the previous piece it referred to. Ms.
Whitehead raised many valid points about the ecological effects of herd
farming, the physiological effects of eating meat, and I'll even agree
that she had a point about the psychological effect of eating a
potentially sentient creature, even though my personal beliefs disagree
with her on the last two points. 
...
The best idea for getting rid of excess animals would be to eat them at
our regular pace, but stop them from reproducing. By eating them, they are
still worth supporting and by reducing the numbers of cattle, the price of
meat will rise as rarity increases, forcing people to find meat
alternatives. Eventually, meat would be a rare luxury to be phased out by
the rich, socially enlightened people who thought it was a bad idea to eat
meat in the first place.

The problem, of course, is getting existing cattle ranchers to co-operate,
which is rather unlikely as they are turning a profit with their current
plan of making burgers.

So my conclusion is this: it?s too late to stop eating meat. We?ve bent
the lives of animals to our needs for thousands of years, and now they are
ours, like it or not. Do we dare to try and free the animals of ourselves?
