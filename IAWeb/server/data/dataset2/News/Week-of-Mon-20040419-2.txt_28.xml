An animal-rights group accused Neiman Marcus Group Inc. yesterday of
trying to ``cyberbully'' it into shutting down a ``Neiman Carcass'' Web
site, which blasts the high-end retailer for selling furs.

The Fund for Animals' neimancarcass.com site claims the retailer supports
``a morally bankrupt and inherently violent industry'' and contributes to
the suffering and death of millions of animals each year by selling fur.
The site also displays photographs of animals killed for fur, information
about anti-fur campaigns and links to other Web sites.

Neiman Marcus claims the Web site is deliberately and confusingly similar
to the retailer's famous name, and is being used to tarnish it. It filed a
complaint with the National Arbitration Forum, which resolves domain name
disputes, in a bid to wrest control of the neimancarcass.com,
neimancarcass.net, and neimancarcass.org names from the animal rights group.
