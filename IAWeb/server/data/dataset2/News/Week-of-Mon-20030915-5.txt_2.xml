Even though Eagle County appears to be mostly free of chronic wasting
disease, a series of recently released scientific reports and reviews
shows there is still plenty of concern about the fatal brain malady.

Some research shows that CWD may spread inexorably across the state -–
including Eagle County – unless wildlife managers take aggressive
management action, including potentially controversial steps like culling
infected animals and thinning at-risk herds.

An independent panel of university researchers and wildlife experts from
around the country reviewed Colorado’s CWD management strategy and issued
a Blue Ribbon report, praising the state’s "diligence and leadership in
investigating the disease and for educating the public … CDOW efforts
serve as a model for other wildlife agencies," the report concludes. 
...
Population density may also be factor: "High animal density and frequency
of contact are associated with increased incidence of infection … no data
available linking density to transmission rate in the wild, but extremely
high prevalence has been observed under captive conditions, suggesting
that transmission may be density dependent, the panel states.

These finding emphasize the need for continued monitoring, testing and
adaptive management. And that includes targeted culling, which means
killing deer and elk in areas where clusters of CWD are found. In past
years, culling has been somewhat controversial politically, generating
some resistance both from animal rights activists and from residents
concerned about disposal issues associated with infected carcasses.
