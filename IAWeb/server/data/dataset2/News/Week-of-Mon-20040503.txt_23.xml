SEVILLE, Spain  For the many around the world who pity Spain's fighting
bulls and the inevitability of their fate, it is worth knowing that bulls
do not always die as planned.

Last Friday, a lean, elegantly weathered 47-year-old bull breeder named
Geronimo Astolfi supervised the loading of eight of his best bulls onto a
truck at his family's ranch in the village of Villaverde del Rio.

The bulls then made the 30-minute trip through the flat countryside and
the traffic circles to Seville and its 18th-century bullring, La
Maestranza, where they were to be inspected before being sent to a
bullfight the following day.

This was a major moment in Astolfi's career. The corridas, or bullfights,
during Seville's April Fair are second in prestige only to those in
Madrid, and though his bulls were used in Madrid last season, it had been
almost eight years since his bulls had been invited to take part in his
home city.

"The last time it did not go well," he said. "They make you pay for it
when it does not go well."
