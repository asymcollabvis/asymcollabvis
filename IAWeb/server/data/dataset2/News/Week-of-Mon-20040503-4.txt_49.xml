Boynton Beach? Protesters on Saturday held neon-colored signs, handed out 
literature and assailed the way "puppy mills" mistreat their animals.

About a dozen protesters who stood in front of Puppy Palace, 3557 Boynton 
Beach Blvd., were part of a statewide campaign to raise awareness about puppy 
mills.
Puppy mills, they said, are cramped, squalid commercial-breeding facilities, 
mostly in the Midwest, that provide puppies to retail pet stores. The 
activists claimed puppy mills produce unhealthy animals that often have genetic 
defects due to inbreeding. 

The Boynton Beach store was sued in 2003 for misrepresenting the quality of 
the puppies it sold.

Puppy Palace's owner denies that it buys from puppy mills. 

Carey Siriani of West Palm Beach owns a border collie, Mia, which came from 
Puppy Palace two years ago. On Saturday Mia was wearing a placard that read 
"Survivor." Mia was neurotic and had terrible allergies, Siriani said, and has 
required thousands of dollars worth of medical treatment.

"We're not a bunch of freaks. We're just trying to educate people," she said. 
"They're going to get big problems in their wallets and a huge heartbreak for 
their kids."
