  <content>??DON?T panic as India is safe from the bird flu. We are 
offering chicken and eggs which are totally safe for human consumption,?? 
screams pamphlets outside one of the chicken shops in Zampa Bazaar area. Many 
others have followed suit with chicken sales recording a drastic fall after the 
news of two million chicken dying in Pakistan of avian influenza rocked the 
country a few days back. 
It appears that the possibility of the virulent flu hopping from Pakistan to 
India has scared the non-vegetarians so much that they now prefer to swear by 
their greens. The result? Slaughter houses have lost loyal customers; such is 
the scare that fresh chicken which was selling between Rs 80 to Rs 90 per kg a 
fortnight back is now being sold at Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg. The scare has hit 
egg sales too. Eggs which were selling at Rs 140 per crate are now being sold 
at Rs 100 per crate. The slaughter houses which were selling about 30,000 to 
35,000 kg of chicken per day are now selling only about 5,000 kg of chicken. </content>
