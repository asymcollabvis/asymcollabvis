Tom and Jeanne Foley of Dawsonville have trained their bichon fris?, Beau, to 
sleep in their bed when they want ? and to leave when they want some alone 
time. Tom bought Jeanne a stuffed animal that looks like Beau for Valentine's 
Day. It's estimated that almost 6 in 10 small dogs share their owners' bed.
 

Even then, they're not totally alone ? the dog, Ozzy Osbourne, still presses 
his nose underneath the door and whines and scratches until the doting owners 
give in and open it.
 
"It's a big romance killer," said 56-year-old Cole, who recently planned a 
weekend getaway in the Georgia mountains. "We decided to go away for Valentine's 
Day to get away from the animals, to have some affection and sex."
 
Dogs, cats and other furry animals are creating a wedge between couples 
across the country as pets move inside the home ? and the bedroom ? in record 
numbers. Like a toddler, or even worse, a photo of your mother-in-law, a pet in 
bed tends to dampen desire.
 
A 1988 survey showed that two-thirds of dogs slept indoors, according to the 
American Pet Products Manufacturers Association. By 2002, 78 percent of dogs 
spent at least some of the evening under the same roof as their owners.</content>
