  FWS ISSUES ADVISORY ON CATFISH IMPORTS INTO FLORIDA
  
  The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is warning ornamental 
  fish merchants not to handle any shipments of tropical 
  catfish from South America that may have come into the 
  United States through  Miami, as the packaging bags may be 
  contaminated with a substance that can cause serious illness. 
  The source of the toxin is unknown, but it is not directly 
  related to the imported fish themselves. The symptoms of 
  this toxin are predominately neurological when the packaging 
  has been handled: tingling of the hands, dialated eyes, 
  breathing difficulty and possibly euphoria. These symptoms 
  develop fairly rapidly, within minutes after contact, 
  depending on the length of contact and amount of toxin 
  absorbed. However, in severe cases, convulsions and even 
  death may occur. 
  
  The FWS has recently learned from the Florida Department 
  of Health that three Florida fish retailers have had employees 
  become ill from handling the catfish containers. In two 
  situations, the retailers could identify specific shipments 
  of cause, but the third patient reported several likely 
  sources. Further investigations by the Centers for Disease 
  Control and Prevention (CDC) may have uncovered additional
  reports of similar illnesses in New York and California. 
  
  "It is imperative that retailers not handle shipments of 
  ornamental catfish coming in from Miami," said Dr. Leslie 
  M. Cannelli, FWS Special Agent "until we have pinned down 
  the exact shipments and causes of the illnesses. But in 
  the meantime anyone who may have handled ornamental catfish 
  shipments should be alert to these possible neurological 
  symptoms and seek medical help if it is needed. They are 
  requested to immediately contact their local police department 
  for assistance." 
  
  The FWS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 
  the states of Florida, New York, and California continue 
  to investigate this situation. While not explicitly identified 
  as responsible for the affected shipments, a list of ten 
  tropical fish import/export businesses of interest, with recent 
  catish shipments from South America, has been circulated:  
  Alberto Salazar Import Export, Aquatic Treasures, Ed Parker 
  Tropical Fish, Global Ways, Imperial Tropical Fish Farm, LB 
  Brandow Tropical Fish, Oceans Reefs and Aquariums, Odd Ball 
  Aquatics, Sanchez Brothers Tropical Fish, and Tidwell Fish Farm.
