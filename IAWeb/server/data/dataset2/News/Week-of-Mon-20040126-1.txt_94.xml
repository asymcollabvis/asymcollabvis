Cambridge University has axed plans for a controversial primate centre to
conduct animal research into brain diseases.

However, the centre could still be built elsewhere, possibly at a location
more protected from action by anti-vivisectionists. The UK Prime Minister
Tony Blair had backed the plan as being "of national importance".

The university blames "escalating costs" caused by years of delays and
security concerns for its decision to axe the centre. But it is being
accused by many of having buckled under a sustained campaign from
animal-rights activists who opposed the centre from the outset. 
...
Cambridge University denies it has been bullied into abandoning its
original plans and vows to carry them out elsewhere.

"It's not a Cambridge issue, it's a national issue," says a university
spokeswoman. "The prime minister, the deputy prime minister and the chief
science adviser have all made it clear they support us in this effort. We
feel confident we will work with them to find a way forward."

Anti-vivisection groups welcomed the climbdown, but feared the centre
might be sited instead at the government's highly secure facility for
biological research at Porton Down in Wiltshire, a suggestion on which the
university would not comment.

"If it were true, it would mark a truly worrying development," said the
British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. BUAV said the government
would be ducking its responsibility to debate the validity of animal
experiments "behind razor wire on military protected land where animal
testing is shrouded in even more secrecy than it is now".</content>
