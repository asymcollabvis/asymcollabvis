Activist and author Carol Adams will speak on ?The Sexual Politics of
Meat,? Tuesday, April 20, from 5-7 p.m. in the Memorial Union Building?s
Theater I on the campus of the University of New Hampshire. Her
presentation is free and open to the public, and a reception and book
signing will follow.

Adams? multimedia presentation will explore the link between the
objectification of women and animals in the modern media. She will provide
an ecofeminist analysis of the interconnected oppressions of sexism,
racism and speciesism by exploring the way popular culture presents images
of race, gender and species. The presentation also will suggest forms of
resistance against the construction of individuals, human or nonhuman, as
?meat.? </content>
