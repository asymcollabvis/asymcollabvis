  <content>Dozens of long-standing residents of Santa Catalina
Island are trading their ocean views for a vast playground in the Great
Plains ? though not by choice.

About a third of the Southern California island's 300 bison were shipped
off this week to South Dakota, where they will live on two Indian
reservations. They were expected to arrive Thursday.

Their trip has been nearly a year in the making as conservationists and
animal welfare advocates worked to find an amicable solution to a
decades-old problem: The nonnative animals have destroyed island plant
life as their numbers have swelled.

"They didn't want to go," joked Bill Dyer, regional director of In Defense
of Animals, which raised more than $25,000 for travel expenses. "We are
happy that the Indian tribes are taking the animals with the understanding
that the bison would not be slaughtered."</content>
