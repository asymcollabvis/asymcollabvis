DELANO -- Record numbers of ducks, ibises, egrets and other waterfowl are 
wintering in a wildlife refuge in the southern San Joaquin Valley, thriving in 
restored wetlands that have been fully flooded for the first time since creation 
of the refuge four decades ago.

Covering the Kern National Wildlife Refuge's 6,500 acres of wetlands in water 
after decades of only having enough resources to water a third of the area 
has turned the marsh into "an oasis in the desert," said Ducks Unlimited 
biologist Chris Hildebrandt.

A federal act passed in 1992 and gradually implemented over the last decade 
has mandated that Central Valley refuges receive a reliable supply of water. To 
the wildlife at Kern -- a wetlands refuge created without its own water 
supply in the middle of thirsty grape and cotton farms -- the Central Valley 
Project Improvement Act has made all the difference.

Thick green tufts of bulrushes, wild millet and other native grasses dot the 
lush marshland, providing food and shelter for familiar birds like mallard 
ducks, the little white-billed black coots and the common moorehen, but also 
attracting more than 6,000 white-faced ibises, a bird hardly seen in the Central 
Valley 10 years ago, and birds that are rare in the area, like tri-colored 
blackbirds. Clusters of cottonwood trees are weighed down by dozens of great blue 
herons in their nests. The majestic bird lives on the frogs and fish it 
catches in the surrounding marsh.

"If you worked at it, you could spot 150 species out here in a day," said 
refuge manager David Hardt.</content>
