State wildlife officers trapped and removed a panther from the western
Everglades early Tuesday morning, after it spent weeks feeding on goats,
emus and other animals at a roadside petting zoo.

They had planned to release the panther about 25 miles to the northwest,
where it could prey on deer and wild hogs. But the panther turned out to
be so thin, with patchy fur and a missing canine tooth, that they
decided to nurse it back to health before turning it loose.
...
The Animal Rights Foundation of Florida, based in Fort Lauderdale, filed
a complaint with the Collier County State Attorney's Office, saying the
filmed attack on the tethered goat constituted a "gruesome case of
animal cruelty."
