Several dozen animal lovers pleaded for sanctuary for 34 macaque monkeys
Friday night, saying the primates have suffered and served as research
subjects long enough.

University of Colorado officials say the macaques remain valuable for
research and aren't going anywhere.

Animal rights organizations, led by the Committee for Research
Accountability, held a candlelight vigil near the macaques' home at the CU
Health Sciences Center near East Eighth Avenue and Colorado Boulevard in
Denver. One sign read: "CU, stop monkeying around with our relatives. Free
the CU 34."</content>
