Fall is time to see bighorns in Hells Canyon
Out &amp; About


A herd of 18 bighorn sheep wanders along the banks of the Snake River in 
Hells Canyon, moseying from rock to rock, drinking from the river, and 
chewing on grass.

Five rams, with massive horns curling over the sides of their heads, are in 
the herd.

What a sight.

A lamb bounds playfully but cautiously between the adult animals.

Wild sheep disappeared from Hells Canyon by the 1940s as a result of 
disease, overhunting and competition with domestic sheep for forage.

Idaho was home to about 100,000 bighorn sheep in the early 1800s. There are 
an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 today.

Bighorn numbers started to decline as soon as the state began to be settled. 
They were easy to hunt and provided food for early miners and settlers. And 
they were -- and still are -- susceptible to diseases like scabies and 
pasturella, which are transmitted from domestic sheep.

As homesteaders brought in more domestic sheep, the bighorns became sick and 
died.

"The bottom line is there is no danger to domestic sheep from wild sheep," 
Cassirer says. "It's only one way."

The main solution now is to keep bighorns and domestic sheep separated.
