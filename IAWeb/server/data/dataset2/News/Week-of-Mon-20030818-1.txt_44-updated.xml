Chinchillas are endangered due to exploitation of the 
animal for fur. Protected wild populations continue 
to decline. Its habitat is threatened by human land 
alterations in north central Chile. Without funds, research 
and conservation wild populations will be extinct in 
the near future. 

"In 1928, a coat made of Bolivian pelts 
cost half a million gold marks". In 1992, a chinchilla fur 
coat cost $22,000. The chinchilla population declined steadily because of 
hunting and trapping. By 1918 Chile had laws against trapping the animal.
Now that populations have increased, poaching has increased
again as well. As the latest fad pet in the U.S., wild 
chinchilla from Chile or Bolivia have become a prize possession.
An individual chinchilla can fetch $700 from frenzied buyers.
