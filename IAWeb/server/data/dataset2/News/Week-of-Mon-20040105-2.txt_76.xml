  <content>The Sierra Club will sue a Solano County dairy for spilling a 
reported 1.3 million gallons of liquid animal waste into local waterways, it 
announced Tuesday.

Heritage Dairy is located about seven miles east of Dixon. The spill took 
place Nov. 9 and Nov. 10, 2003, county and state officials have said.
"We want folks in Solano County and Northern California to become sensitive 
to the impacts of these megadairies," said Vicki Lee of the Sierra Club.

The Sierra Club plans to file a federal lawsuit as early as March 1 under the 
Clean Water Act. It must give 60 days notice to the dairy owner and 
regulators, said Brent Newell, the attorney representing the club.

At issue is whether a spill occurred, Newell said. The club under the Clean 
Water Act doesn't have to prove the dairy acted recklessly, he said.

"The Heritage Dairy has an absolute duty to not discharge any pollution 
whatsoever," Newell said.


The club will seek a civil penalty of up to $27,500 per day for a spill it 
contends could have lasted two days. Newell said money would go into the federal 
treasury.</content>
