A number of letters to the editor arrived this week 
regarding  Global Ways tropical fish shipments, including these:
...
I can imagine that I could import tropical fish without risks of DOA, but
not using Global Ways shippers. My last shipment had over 80% fatalities
and I'm still awaiting satisfaction from this group...
...
I urge your readers to *not* use Global Ways ... low survival rates, 
poor packaging, poor responsiveness. I can't imagine how they stay
in business. We will never use them again.
...
...the packaging on my last shipment of Tigrinus Catfish was abominable.
Shipping bags were covered in some noxious substance that caused our 
handlers hands to go numb and eventually need emergency medical treatment. 
You can imagine the condition of the fish themselves. Less than 10% 
survived their trip. We are proceeding with legal action against Global. 
...
In response to these comments, Global Ways spokeman blamed an inexperienced
packer in South America for problems in a very few shipments. "We are working
with these customers and have guaranteed them satisfaction. A problem occurred
in a very small number of the 5000 shipments we handled last quarter. We regret any 
inconveniences and remain dedicated to providing the highest quality service."
