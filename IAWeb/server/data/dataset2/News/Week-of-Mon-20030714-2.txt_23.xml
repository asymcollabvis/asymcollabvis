Several months ago, the Washington City Paper, our weekly ?alternative?
newsweekly, ran a feature article that took a critical look at the Fresh
Fields grocery store chain. If you are unfamiliar with Fresh Fields
supermarkets (owned by the Whole Foods grocery chain), they are basically
like your typical food co-op transformed into a regular grocery store. The
typical Fresh Fields market has just about every vegetarian item being
distributed, a large produce section, a bakery, and a deli where you can
find ?free range? meats. The prices are high, so it?s not surprising that
the Fresh Fields I visit on occasion is populated by upper middle class
Yuppies.

Then I started reading between the lines. This was not your average
alternative newsweekly fluff piece; this was a cleverly placed stealth
article by a writer who was friendly to the right-wing libertarian
Manhattan Institute, a Washington think tank. The article certainly took
the Fresh Fields chain to task for its Yuppie clientele and expensive
vegetarian food. But it had nothing to say about the fact that Fresh
Fields stores aren?t unionized (workers are paid far less than unionized
corporate grocery stores in the area) nor did it mention the strange
financial backers of the chain, in this case being a bunch of investors
who are affiliated with defense contractors. The article also didn?t
bother to provide a more radical critique, which could have pointed out,
that a corporate chain selling free range chicken is no substitute for a
worker-owned food co-op. No, the writer used cheap attacks on Yuppie
vegetarians to veil her real agenda, which was attacking the organic food
movement and current activism against genetically modified food.
