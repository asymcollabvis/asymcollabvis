Leave it to a sweet-faced Holstein to remind us of the ugly work of
bringing beef to the dinner table. When the nation's first confirmed case
of mad cow disease cropped up in December, Americans received a crash
course on the nastier aspects of the cattle business. We learned, for
instance, that cows walking up the slaughterhouse line are often stunned
with a blow to the head, which can spew bits of brain into the muscle.
That there's a process called "advanced meat recovery" in which the
meat?later ground into tasty sausages or ballpark hotdogs?is sheared so
close to the bone that it often contains spinal cord tissue. And that
newborn dairy calves often survive on a formula fortified with protein
from the blood of their brethren.

With the mad cow scare, many of these practices are on their way out. Yet
there's plenty about the way meat is raised in the United States that can
turn the stomach of even the heartiest carnivore. So, it's no surprise
some companies have decided there may be a market for meat raised in less
grisly conditions. Burgerville, a Northwestern chain, announced this week
that it would buy beef solely from "a cooperative of 40 sustainable family
ranches dedicated to raising cattle in harmony with nature, without the
use of hormones, antibiotics, genetically modified grain or any animal
by-products." All of this sounds very lovely to the consumer, but how much
difference does it make to the cow? And just how bad do the animals that
end up in the grocery store really have it?

To answer these questions, Slate presents this guide to what happens to
your meat?whether it's beef, pork, or poultry?on its way to the table.</content>
