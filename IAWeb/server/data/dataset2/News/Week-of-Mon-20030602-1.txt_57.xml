War dog makes it out of Iraq 

Once-scruffy Fluffy overcomes red tape, finds home in U.S.


The Pentagon called it Operation Free Fluffy and, thanks to dogged 
determination by the Army and others, the decidedly unconventional rescue mission now 
ranks as another win in the war in Iraq. Fluffy, the once-malnourished commando 
canine who protected a U.S. Special Forces unit in northern Iraq, was reunited 
over the weekend with the Army handler who could not bear to leave the loyal 
dog behind in Iraq. "People pulled together for a dog who supported us the 
whole time we were in Iraq and put himself on the line for our country," said 
Sgt. 1st Class Russell Joyce, an Army Special Forces soldier and Fluffy's 
handler. Fluffy is now ensconced in Joyce's North Carolina home, where he is enjoying 
the best living ever in his estimated two years of life, including a new 
doghouse Joyce built -- decked out with a marble floor, courtesy of leftover 
construction materials -- and nutritious American dog food, a far cry from the 
scraps he had barely subsisted on.
