The committee, which has already rejected the idea of outlawing all snares in 
its Stage 1 report, voted down Dr Scott?s bid to insert a total ban in the 
Bill.

She said: ?Snares are indiscriminate, and have a significant by ? catch, 
including species such as otters, badgers and domestic pets, and we know that 
snaring isn?t the most effective method of vermin control.?

The United Kingdom is one of just five European Union countries that still 
permits snaring.

But Mr Wilson insisted: ?Snares should remain available to land managers as a 
legitimate method of dealing with pests, but they must be used responsibly 
and professionally in accordance with the law.

?Undoubtedly the use and abuse of snares does take place, but the answer is 
not to penalise landowners and managers who already act reasonably, but to 
clamp down on those who are causing the problem, and that?s what the Bill does.?

The Bill explicitly outlaws the use or possession of any self-locking snare ? 
a wire loop ?killing trap? that tightens as the animal struggles ? while 
still permitting ?free-running? snares ? subject to regular checks at a maximum 
24-hour interval.

It prohibits the ?calculated setting? of any snare to deliberately cause 
unnecessary suffering to any animal, while banning the setting of a snare that is 
likely to cause injury to a protected species.

Several amendments for extra safeguards ? including a crimped stop to protect 
free-running snares from self-locking due to struggling animals or rust ? 
were withdrawn when Mr Wilson said ministers would consider these technical areas 
and impose new regulations if necessary.</content>
