OMG!


CLACKAMAS COUNTY - It's the worst case of wildlife poaching that local game 
officers have ever seen, and it was discovered in Portland's backyard. 
Last week KATU's Grant McOmie reported the worst illegal garbage dump that 
land managers had ever seen. 
Nearly 100 yards of household trash was left in the Mt. Hood National Forest. 
Disgusting? You bet! 
But it's nothing compared to what trooper Mike Hansen showed KATU Wednesday 
morning. 
Forty-nine Canadian Geese were shot and dumped off Maple Lane in Clackamas 
County. 
The geese, each weighing 10 pounds or more, were killed and thrown to rot in 
a creek bed in last four days. 
"Obviously they did a lot of shooting - took a lot of birds and just wasted 
them," said officer Mike Hanson. 
Wildlife biologists said it might be a case of 'poaching opportunity,' as 
thousands of geese pass through our area at this time of year. 
"Sometimes its greed, sometimes it's opportunity, sometimes it's even 
frustration with heavy goose use on a property, there may be some frustration from 
the landowner," said biologist Don Vandebergh. 
What makes this so terrible is the absolute waste of the animals, this is not 
the case of an illegal hunter, this is an outright poaching case. 
More importantly, Oregon State Police - Fish and Wildlife is going to need 
all the help they can get from the public to find the criminals. 
If you have any information about this crime call: 
TIP: 'Turn-in-a-Poacher' 1-800-452-7888 
OSP Game Officer Mike Hanson: 731-3027, extension 427. 
Officer Hanson has few clues to this wildlife crime and he could use your 
help. 
"Hunters, birdwatchers, everyone - I mean these are their birds! To just 
shoot them and dump them is unbelievable," said Hanson.
