A hunter accused by state wildlife officers of poaching a trophy elk last 
fall pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Pitkin County Court.

A jury trial for Marc McKinney of El Jebel was set for May 14 by Judge Erin 
Fernandez Ely.

McKinney?s attorney, Arnie Mordkin, said before the court appearance that 
negotiations with the district attorney?s office weren?t successful. In court, 
Mordkin referred to the case as ?a little more peculiar than usual.?

McKinney was charged by the Colorado Division of Wildlife for allegedly using 
salt and minerals to attract a cow elk to a hunting site on national forest 
east of Aspen. Later that same day, Sept. 11, he shot a trophy bull that 
wandered onto the site, according to the allegations.

The elk were killed during archery season. McKinney?s possession of a hunting 
license isn?t an issue.

After an investigation by wildlife officers, McKinney was ticketed on Oct. 7 
for two counts of illegal possession of wildlife, unlawful taking of wildlife 
and aggravated illegal possession of wildlife.</content>
