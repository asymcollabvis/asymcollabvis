Taiwan needs sound regulations on butchering chickens, as half of all 
domestic chickens were killed in traditional markets under unhygienic conditions, 
environmental and animal rights activists said yesterday in the wake of the 
avian-flu outbreak. 
Dozens of activists yesterday delivered a petition to the Control Yuan, 
asking for an investigation into governmental agencies in charge of public health 
and agricultural products. Activists performed a skit of the Executive Yuan 
failing to supervise its subordinates to prevent avian flu.
"The hygiene required when butchering chickens could not be stressed more at 
this point, where we are exposed to the potential spread of avian flu," said 
Chen Yu-min (??????), director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan.
