The mad cow scare may have prompted some consumers to give up T-bone steak.

But there's no escaping the humble cow.

Gel capsules often are made from bovine gelatin. Bars of soap probably
come from processed cow tallow, which is solid fat. Asphalt roads may
contain bovine fatty acids. Cars and trucks may ply those roads on rubber
tires made with cow oils.

Even wars can depend on cows. The explosive nitroglycerine is manufactured
from glycerine, which is extracted from cow fat.

Cattle byproducts, simply put, are one of the glues that hold together the
industrialized world.

The discovery of a Washington Holstein with mad cow disease turned the
spotlight on the world of beef cattle, brains, spinal cords and meat. The
discovery also pointed to a largely unseen world in which cattle parts
turn into chicken feed, mayonnaise and sex hormones -- and the potential
that byproducts from an infected cow might transmit bovine spongiform
encephalopathy to humans. Federal authorities insist that is not a
significant risk. 
...
So the humble cow continues to yield fertilizer from dried blood, buttons
from hooves, neat's-foot oil from shin bones and toothpaste from fats.
Even the lowly gallstone is exported to China, where it is thought to have
mystical values, according to "The Meat We Eat" (Interstate Publishers,
1994, 1,193 pages).

"We're sometimes referred to as the original recyclers," said Tom Cook,
president of the National Renderers Association. "We take a lot of
material that would otherwise have no value and convert it into products
that do have value."
