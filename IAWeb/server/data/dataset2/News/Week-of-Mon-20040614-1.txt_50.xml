The Cole Bros. Circus is coming to Dodd Stadium this weekend. Lyndsay
Meiklem of Norwich is not going.

Meiklem objects to the circus' use of animals in its performances.

"In the year 2004, it's an extremely antiquated form of entertainment,"
she said. "I think it's a really cruel form of entertainment."

Meiklem, 29, is organizing a protest outside the event and will
distribute fliers with information about the issue.

She said circus animals live in artificial conditions and are forced to
suppress their natural instincts through abusive training tactics.

"How we treat animals is a very important issue," she said. "How we
treat them is a direct reflection of our own society."
