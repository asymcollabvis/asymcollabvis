Turlock?s animal shelter has been posting stellar adoption rates for its 
furry wards, saving more than 500 animals through a concerted, active campaign by 
dedicated staff members.

The shelter is looking into upgrading its current facility with a new 
16-kennel building and an office and procedure building complete with a lounge area 
where people would be allowed play with any animals they may be considering for 
adoption.

The Turlock Animal Shelter saved 538 dogs from being euthanized in 2003, just 
more than half of the 1,041 canines that have seen the inside of the tiny 
building?s walls.

?We are very active in trying to find homes for the animals in our care,? 
said Senior Animal Control Officer Glena Jackson. ?We have a web site where we 
post the images of our animals, updated every 24 hours, we actively check for 
vacancies at no-kill shelters and of course have the pet page in the paper.?

Even for all of that effort, there are some animals which just cannot be 
saved, particularly wild cats.

?Sixty percent of the cats we get are feral,? said Jackson. ?We do our best 
to find homes for what animals we can, but there are just some animals which 
are not fit for adoption.?

In addition, the race to adoption is made more difficult by the cramped 
facilities the shelter currently occupies.

?We have had to put up to three dogs in these kennels,? Jackson said. ?
Kennels ... are meant for one animal.?</content>
