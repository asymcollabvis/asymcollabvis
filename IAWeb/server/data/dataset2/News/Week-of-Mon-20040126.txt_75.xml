State lawmakers are unlikely to put any profound stamp on the ongoing 
efforts to alleviate worries about mad cow disease. With the federal 
government controlling the investigation and Congress monopolizing the 
debate over what so-called "downer" cows can be used for after they are 
slaughtered, the state Legislature seems resigned to take only baby steps. 
"We're going to have to take some sort of lead from the federal 
government," said state Rep. Mark Schoesler (R-Ritzville). "We're going to 
go through fine-tuning some of these measures. If there's a better idea out 
there, I'm open to it."

Perhaps most notably, the Legislature is mulling plans that would prevent 
the sale and transport of downer cows, or animals that can't stand up 
because of injury or illness.


Lawmakers also are discussing proposals to give meat packers a tax break, 
develop an animal identification system and refine the state's ability to 
quarantine diseased animals. The proposals are somewhat modest, though not 
without value, lawmakers say. Two of them - dealing with quarantines and 
animal identification - were in the works long before the mad cow 
discovery.

The greatest debate is likely to be reserved for what limitations, if any, 
lawmakers put on the use of downer cows. Bills introduced in the 
Legislature would ban only the sale and transport, except to deliver the 
animals to a veterinarian. The Washington Cattlemen's Association and the 
Washington Dairy Federation have backed that plan. However, those measures 
- House Bill 2802 and Senate Bill 6408 - do not put limits on what downer 
cows can be used for after they are euthanized.
