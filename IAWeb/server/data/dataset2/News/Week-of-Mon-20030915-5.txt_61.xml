Treated unfairly, monkeys go on strike
Unequal rewards immediately noticed, researcher finds


Peace-loving capuchin monkeys may not carry picket signs like workers in a 
labor dispute, but the little animals do balk at unequal pay -- and they'll 
even go on strike if they see they're being treated unfairly -- researchers 
have found.

A piece of humdrum cucumber, according to researchers, just doesn't do it 
for a hard-working female capuchin -- especially if she sees her partner 
being rewarded with a tasty grape for performing little or no work. The 
monkey will simply do the primate equivalent of putting down her tools -- 
rejecting the measly cucumber and stopping work -- until she gets equal pay.

"Wouldn't you resent it, too, if you found that your colleagues at The San 
Francisco Chronicle were getting more bylines than you, even though they're 
doing a lot less work to get the credit?" asked Sarah Brosnan, a graduate 
researcher at the famed Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta. 
"Well, our monkeys feel that way, too, and they act on it to make sure 
they're treated right," she said.

The findings, published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, shed 
light on the evolutionary advantages of cooperation among animals in the 
wild, said Brosnan, because they suggest that such behavior can make a group 
of monkeys more closely knit and better able to avoid predators.

Brosnan and Frans de Waal, director of the Yerkes center's "Living Links" 
laboratory at Emory University, have completed the first experimental 
demonstration of fairness and unfairness in nonhuman primates, and they 
believe they have found excellent analogies to human behavior.
