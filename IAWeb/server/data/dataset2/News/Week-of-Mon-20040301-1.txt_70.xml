Susan Gardner of Orleans and her daughters didn't see the accident when it 
happened last June, but they heard the screech and knew it was bad. 
"It was, 'Uh oh. Which dog got it? Oh, no,'" she said. 
Sadly, the dog that had been hit by the truck was their own dog Mellow, who 
had been across the street playing with other dogs. 
"He just ran in front of a truck," Gardner said. "The fur, the skin was off 
the bone." 
Gardner took Mellow to Eastham Veterinary Hospital, but the situation looked 
grim. Surgery or amputation was possible, but even the $1,500 for amputation 
was too steep for Gardner, a mother of four. 
"We were all set to put him down because we couldn't afford the surgery," she 
said. 
But then an employee suggested applying to the Sampson Fund for Veterinary 
Care, an Orleans-based nonprofit organization that helps pay veterinary expenses 
at participating animal hospitals, including Eastham Veterinary Hospital. 
Gardner agreed, and Mellow's leg was amputated. 
"Mellow went through the surgery fine, the amputation," Gardner said. "He was 
home in two days. He gets along better than he did with four legs. He bounced 
back really quick." 
Mellow is one of the fund's success stories since it was founded in 1986 with 
a $25 donation to Harwich veterinarian Christopher Donner. The Sampson Fund 
assists animals in need of substantial veterinary care but whose owners may not 
have the money. Participating veterinarians cut their costs by 20 percent, 
and then the owner pays a small percentage. The fund picks up the rest. 
The fund is named in honor of Sampson, a stray cat whose owners gave the 
money to Donner to help another animal. 
"The fund grew from there," fund vice president Bob Bourgoin said. "We took 
care of 42 animals in 2003 at a cost of $14,000.</content>
