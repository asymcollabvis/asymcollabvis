Most people don't know this, but the National Western Stock Show is also a
convention of various species of livestock. During visiting hours, the
cattle, sheep and swine just stand around looking pretty, but in the wee
hours of the morning, they assemble to discuss current issues and how they
might best respond.

Few people have been privileged to observe these deliberations, but over
the years, I've made some good connections - among them, a grumpy old
Hereford range bull who smuggled me in to the American Bovine Congress in
a small building off Washington Street on Sunday night.

About two dozen cattle, representing all the well-known breeds and a few
that aren't, were present when the chairsteer, a Texas Longhorn whose moo
had a twangy drawl, called the meeting to order and explained the agenda:
"First, we have to determine whether there is an outbreak of Mad Human
Disease in the United States. Then, if there is, we must decide how to
respond to it. So, if anyone has any evidence one way or another, take the
floor."
...
"But what about PETA? Those crazy humans want to take away that good life
of yours. They say you're being abused and tortured."

The Bucking Bull admitted that it was one of his great pleasures to break
a human leg or neck every so often, so he couldn't see how that was abuse.
Thus he agreed that PETA could be a symptom of Mad Human Disease.
