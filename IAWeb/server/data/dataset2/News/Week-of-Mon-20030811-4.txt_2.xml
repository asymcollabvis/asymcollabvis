Wolves staking claims
in White Clouds

After a one-year hiatus, gray wolves have returned to the White Cloud 
Mountains, renewing a debate in central Idaho over how huge tracts of 
federal land in and around the region are managed.

Ketchum resident Jack Corrock measures his right hand against one of 
hundreds of wolf prints set in a muddy pond bed adjacent to Squaw Creek, in 
Custer County. The prints were left by members of the Buffalo Ridge Pack, 
which was seen repeatedly last spring near Clayton before moving into the 
highlands. Express photo by Willy Cook

Wolf advocates have applauded a federal ruling this year that prohibits 
federal officials from killing wolves that prey on livestock in the Sawtooth 
National Recreation Area, which includes the White Clouds. At the same time, 
many object to grazing permits that allow thousands of sheep and cattle to 
be placed in proximity of known wolf dens in the 756,000-acre SNRA.
