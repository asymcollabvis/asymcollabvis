The federal indictment unveiled yesterday against Stop Huntingdon Animal
Cruelty is only part of a larger assault federal authorities have
launched against alleged animal rights extremists and others behind what
the FBI dubbed "special interest terrorism."

"The FBI has made the prevention and investigation of animal rights
extremists (and) eco-terrorism ... a domestic terrorism investigative
priority," said John E. Lewis, a deputy assistant FBI director in
counterterrorism. 
...
Lewis named SHAC along with the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth
Liberation Front in describing the tactics.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, however, questioned
yesterday whether legitimate activism was under attack.

"Some of the names being bandied about in this instance are longtime
activists and well respected," said PETA spokeswoman Lisa Lange,
referring to the SHAC indictment. 
...
"It has gone beyond mere activism and protests," said David Martosko,
research director for the Center for Consumer Freedom, a nonprofit group
supporting the food industry and animal researchers.
...
The center joined representatives from Kentucky Fried Chicken in
asserting before the Senate committee that PETA supports violent tactics,
a claim PETA denies.
