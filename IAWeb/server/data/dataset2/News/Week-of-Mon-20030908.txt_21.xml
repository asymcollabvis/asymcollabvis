Beginning September 8, activists will maintain a daily lunch
hour presence outside the Massachusetts Teachers Association's (MTA)
headquarters at 20 Ashburton Place in Boston.
Organized by the Ethical Science and Education Coalition (ESEC), this
protest will draw attention to the MTA's opposition to Massachusetts House
Bill 1252, An Act Relative to Dissection Choice.
Introduced by Representative Louis Kafka (D-Sharon), H.1252 will protect
students from academic penalty if their religious or ethical beliefs require
alternatives to animal dissection.
From September 8 until the day of the bill?s hearing at the State House,
activists will inform the public about MTA?s continuing opposition to
granting students the legally protected right to choose humane alternatives
to traditional specimen dissection.
The MTA's interference in lobbying against H.1252 has kept passage of this
bill at bay for years, despite compelling evidence that many MA teachers
support such legislation. Says ESEC president Dr. Theo Capaldo, "A recent
Tufts University (2001) study shows that a nearly two-thirds or 64% of
Massachusetts life science teachers support a dissection choice bill."
