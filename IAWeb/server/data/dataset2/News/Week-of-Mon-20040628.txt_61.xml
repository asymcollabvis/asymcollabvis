Open House Cancelled

The Open House that had been scheduled for the 
Shravaana Exotic Animal Sanctuary has been 
postponed due to illness, reports spokesman 
Marcus James.

We're confident this will be resolved soon, and 
we will resume our normal schedule as soon as 
possible.

The wildly famous Rap singer r'Bear was admitted 
to the University of California Medical Center 
last yesterday.  The reason for the hospital 
stay has not been released.

However, an employee who has asked not to be identified, 
stated that the megastar appeared seriously ill 
yesterday afternoon when he was transported by ambulance 
yesterday afternoon.

His face was all bumpy, and he had a fever, the 
employee reported.  He acted like he had the flu, 
you know?  All kinds of achy and sore.  And he was, 
like, really tired all morning.

James has promised to release news of the megastar's 
condition as soon as information is available.
