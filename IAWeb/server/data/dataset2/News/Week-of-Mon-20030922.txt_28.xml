  <content>...Imagine If You Could Import Tropical Fish
Without Risks of Death On Arrival (DOA)

Now you can.

With Global Ways as your business partner and friend, we appreciate your business and we strive to provide the best freshwater fish and services.

With professional packing and quality fishes, our DOA records have been shown to be less than the competition. We guarantee every fish that leaves our farm will ARRIVE ALIVE at its destination after leaving our system.

How can we make this guarantee, you ask?

This is because we are confident that:

1. You only get healthy specimens.
2. You only receive the fishes by fast, reliable method of shipping.
(Fastest air flight from South America to your airport)
3. Professional packing decreases the odds of DOAs.
