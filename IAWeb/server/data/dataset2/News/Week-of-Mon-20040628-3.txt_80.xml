Shoppers and shopkeepers at the upscale Promenade at Sagemore Shopping
Center found something missing Saturday from the two ponds in front.

While the two fountains spewed water high into the air and several ducks
swam, about 30 geese that had frequented the ponds were gone.

Protesters said they were shot and killed by the property's manager,
Davis Enterprises, which had received a federal permit to kill the geese
that had lived in the ponds since the shopping center opened.

Davis Enterprises wouldn't say Friday what happened to the geese. No one
could be reached on Saturday for comment.

"One thing is for sure," said David Sauder, coordinator of Animal Rights
Activists of New Jersey, "if you look around, you won't find a single
goose on the property. They're all gone."
