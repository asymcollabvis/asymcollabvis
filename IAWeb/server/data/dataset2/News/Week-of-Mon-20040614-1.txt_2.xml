The FBI says eco-terrorism -- acts of violence in protest of harm to
animals or to the environment -- is the United States' No. 1 terrorism
threat from inside its own borders.

In the early 1990s, biotech executives and scientists were inundated by
harassment and violence in the United Kingdom and Europe. In 1996, the
violence began spreading to the United States when demonstrators burned
a U.S. Forest Service truck in the Willamette National Forest in Oregon.
In August 2003, two pipe bombs exploded at Chiron, a pharmaceutical
company in Emeryville, California, followed by another explosion in
September 2003 at Shaklee, a health and beauty products company in
Pleasanton, California. 

The FBI has linked much of the harassment and violence to groups
including SHAC (Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty), the Animal Liberation
Front and the Earth Liberation Front. But the groups have largely evaded
authorities by operating in cells and using aliases.
