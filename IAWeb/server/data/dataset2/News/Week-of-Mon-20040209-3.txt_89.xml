  <content>No one can be sure how long the once-fluffy white dog was chained. Weeks? 
Months? A year or more? 
It certainly had been there since he was a puppy, digging into his neck as he 
grew, month by month, until his skin grew over it, in and around the links of 
his grotesque necklace. 
Animal workers in Kinston are outraged, calling it the worst case of animal 
abuse they've ever seen. 
Animal Control Officer Pat Smith found the dog earlier this week behind an 
abandoned house on Water Street, tangled in the chain. Fortunately for the dog, 
someone working at a house next door saw the animal suffering and called the 
authorities. 
"When I found him, he was almost dead," Smith said. "I haven't cried over a 
dog like that in a right good while, but after I found him, well, I cried my 
share."</content>
