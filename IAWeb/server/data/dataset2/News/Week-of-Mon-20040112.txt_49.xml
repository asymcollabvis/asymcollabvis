Please help the animals at the Page County VA shelter not freeze to death.
  
Friends - the piece of crap shelter they have at Page County isn't keeping out the elements.  There is a constant draft from the outside part of the kennels into the inside part.  Further, when the kennels are hosed out, the water runs into the inside part of the kennel.  It's freezing since it's in the single digits in Page.  The dogs were literally hopping around this morning to keep from having to stand on the icy floors.
 
I got a call from Stacy at the shelter this morning.  She was in tears when she told me what was going on.  I've emailed the state vet and the County and if they don't do something tomorrow, we're going to need hundreds of phone calls and emails to both the County office and the state vet's office.  Actually, I know damn well that the County doesn't care.  PLEASE call the County office and ask them what they're doing to keep the animals from freezing to death up there.  Tell them that you've been told that the kennels are iced over.  If they get enough phone calls, they'll take us seriously.  Be polite but firm.  The number is .  It is crucial that you try to do this tomorrow, Monday, 1/12/04.  There is no County Administrator in place, so just leave your message with the Receptionist.  I know how they are up there, and if we don't force them to do something, they won't.
 
In the meantime, please look at Petfinder and let me know if you can take any dogs.
