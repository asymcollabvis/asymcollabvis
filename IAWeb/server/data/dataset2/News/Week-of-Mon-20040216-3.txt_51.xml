A small falcon trapped in the press box at Greyhound Arena gave biologist 
Tony Gennaro a frightened stare as he tried to coax it to safety on Wednesday 
afternoon. 
Talking gently to the bird as if it were a scared 6-month-old child, Gennaro 
was able to corner and catch the male American Kestrel Falcon with his hands. 
Gennaro said the bird, which has been flying around the Eastern New Mexico 
University arena since last Thursday, is doing fine and is surprisingly 
energetic. 
It will be cared for by a student and released on Friday, Gennaro said. 
?It?s amazing; I didn?t think they could go that long without food. But he?
s doing great. He seems to be eating, he?s resting and hopefully he?ll be OK,?
 said Gennaro, a professor emeritus with ENMU?s biology department. 
Gennaro and Dawn Davis, a biologist with the Department of Game and Fish, 
first tried to capture the bird with a small mouse trap and a small white mouse. 
After the trap failed to work properly, Gennaro slowly approached the bird 
and calmly caught it with his hands. </content>
