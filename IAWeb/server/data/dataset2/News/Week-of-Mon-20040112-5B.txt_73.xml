In a small corner of Kenya, where banditry and poaching were once rife, a 
unique conservation project supported by Tusk Trust has brought hope and security 
to humans and animals alike. W F Deedes reports

Africa's darkness is often lit by candles we don't see. This is a candle, I 
thought, as Ian Craig drove us through the Sarara valley in northern Kenya, one 
of the wildlife conservation areas in the region that he has inspired. It was 
such a beautiful African evening, sunny, silent, still. Not a leaf stirring.

"It's been quiet here for five years," says Craig. Before that, the bandits 
had taken charge. "Gangs of 20 or more," he reflects, as we drive past two 
giraffes that eye us calmly.
"They know they're safe," I murmur.
"They're learning that they're safe," amends Ian.
"The bandits," he resumes, "rendered human and animal life intolerable. 
Foreign invaders made this area impossible. They stole cattle, killed elephants for 
their ivory - and anyone who got in the way. They had no hesitation in 
killing policemen. They were very aggressive."</content>
