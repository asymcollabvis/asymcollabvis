- A burgeoning livestock industry in North Dakota could be a key to future 
economic development, however, one official suggests residents of the state are 
taking the wrong approach when it comes to this industry.

The state has lost thousands of dairy farms in the past 15 years and protests 
over recent large-scale hog developments in Towner and Cavalier counties 
could harm small-town economic development in the long term, according to Ward 
County Extension Agent Mike Rose. 

As a result, he created a 10-minute slide presentation that is designed to 
show why large livestock operations could be an economic shot in the arm for 
North Dakota. 

The program, which Rose has shown at least six times in the Minot area, is 
titled "Not In My Back Yard." It focuses on the advantages of livestock, and 
gives statistics to clarify his remarks.

"I put this together to give to non-ag audiences and provoke thought and 
questions," Rose said. "The whole idea is to provoke a thought about this."</content>
