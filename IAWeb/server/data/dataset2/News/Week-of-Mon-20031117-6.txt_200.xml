Scoffing at fears of disease or animal protection laws, most residents in Shanghai have eaten wildlife such as frogs, tortoises and snakes and a large portion of these will do so again, a survey said Sunday. 

The study carried out in the wake of the Severa Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak -- suspected to have been triggered by wild animal consumption -- found that out of 400 Shanghainese, 83 percent admitted to eating wildlife. 

And despite warnings against eating exotic creatures, only 57.5 percent of respondents said they would spare wildlife from their dinner table, the Xinhua news agency said. 

Of these, only 1.9 percent said they would hold back because animals deserve to be protected.
