 Appaled by the laxity of the authorities in seizing banned ivory items from 
traders in Delhi, the Delhi High Court today gave a time limit of eight weeks 
to the Chief Wildlife Warden to seize these items. 
There are about 183 ivory traders in the Capital and till date, the Delhi 
government has seized articles from only 44 such traders. 

Wildlife Protection Society, through its counsel Raj Panjwani, argued that 
though ivory trade was banned in 1991, till date the authorities have done 
little to seize the banned items. 
Justice Manmohan Sarin, in an earlier hearing, had described the attitude of 
the authorities as ??a classic case of passing the buck??. 
The Chief Wildlife Warden, in his reply to the court, had first cited lack of 
space in its godowns. It also added that there were problems relating to 
providing security at the godowns. In 2002, on court orders, a godown was made 
available at Kamla Nehru Ridge, along with additional security. 
The authorities then said that they were still facing problems of lack of 
space. Undeterred by these pleas, the court today directed that all ivory items 
be seized from traders within eight weeks. </content>
