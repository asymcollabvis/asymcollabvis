  <content>Genetic markers commonly found in modern humans all over the world 
could be evidence that our earliest ancestors were cannibals, according to 
new research. Scientists suggest that even today many of us carry a gene 
that evolved as protection against brain diseases that can be spread by 
eating human flesh.
The brain diseases, called prion diseases, are characterized by loss of 
coordination, dementia, paralysis, and eventually death. Modern examples 
include Creutzfeld Jacob disease and kuru in humans, and mad cow disease, or 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, in animals.


An Iwan warrior in Papua, New Guinea wears his native dress, including a 
bone through his nose, a reminder that his tribe were once cannibals.




Fried human, barbecued human, broiled human, raw humanâ€¦were these items on 
the menu of the day for our prehistoric ancestors? Quite possibly, according 
to genetic researchers.

Scientists from England, Australia, and Papua New Guinea say that 
cannibalism is the most likely explanation for their discovery that genes 
protecting against brain diseases that can be contracted by eating 
contaminated flesh have long been spread throughout the world.

A growing body of evidence, such as piles of human bones with clear signs of 
human butchery, suggests cannibalism was widespread among ancient cultures. 
The discovery of this genetic resistance, which shows signs of having spread 
as a result of natural selection, supports the physical evidence for 
cannibalism, say the scientists.</content>
