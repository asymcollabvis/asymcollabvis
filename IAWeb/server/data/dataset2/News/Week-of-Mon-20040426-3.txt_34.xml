PASADENA -- Investigators discovered hair fibers at the scene of last
summer's SUV arson spree that they hoped to link to hair provided by
jailed Caltech graduate student Bill Cottrell, according to search
warrants unsealed Friday.

A federal judge ordered the release of 48 search warrants connected to the
investigation of the arsons -- an act claimed by the Earth Liberation
Front --revealing new details of the arrests of Cottrell and of Pomona
activist Josh Connole.

Also Friday, at the Central Detention Center in San Bernardino, Cottrell
submitted to a judge's order to provide the FBI with a saliva sample.
Investigators hope to use "nuclear DNA" in his saliva to link him to hair
found on a hat at the crime scene, according to Cottrell's attorneys. The
investigators had already obtained hair samples from Cottrell, but could
only use it to compare "mitochondrial DNA."
