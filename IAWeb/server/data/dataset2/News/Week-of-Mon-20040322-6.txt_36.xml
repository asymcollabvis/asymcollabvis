  <content>Behind the glass doors of a little gray building
tucked into the heart of Aggieland, a colorful band of postmodern Dr.
Frankensteins creates life in petri dishes.

Duane Kraemer and his crew of animal scientists at Texas A&amp;M University's
cloning laboratory have made history four times in the past five years,
turning the stuff of science fiction into a cast of lovable, man-made
animals that have captured headlines and imaginations around the world.

Dewey the deer, cc the cat, Second Chance the bull, and a dozen other
animal clones created at the Reproductive Sciences Laboratory are the
furry faces of groundbreaking research that helped science arrive at the
cloned human embryo recently announced in South Korea.
...
Although no one has ever tried to harm or set free any of the cloned
creatures, Dewey and the others live in secret locations just in case.
Animal-rights groups "have very different priorities from ours,"
Blue-McClendon said diplomatically. "Let's leave it at that."
...
Conservationists compete for funding and worry that cloning will lead to a
cavalier attitude about endangered species.

Animal-rights groups denounce cloning failures as indescribable cruelty to
animals.

Ethicists wonder whether humans will come to view animals as objects
rather than living beings.

Fears about cloning are the same ones that cropped up with each milestone
in Kraemer's career, he said. He's convinced that they'll be resolved when
the public gains a better understanding of the science.

To that end, Kraemer, a media-savvy scientist, finishes up yet another
interview with a TV reporter before driving away in his white pickup to
one of his favorite lunch spots: The Lion's Club.</content>
