Jolanta ?Jola? Hernik of Poznan, Poland chose to volunteer at Mission: Wolf, 
a sanctuary for captive wolves and wolf-dog crosses located in the south east 
corner of Custer County, because she wanted to work with people who are 
driven by their ideals, not money. Being close to nature and working with animals 
were also part of her motivation to take on a six-month internship at Mission: 
Wolf. She has found these things and more. The 26 year old Hernik arrived at 
the remote 449 acre refuge on Dec. 9 and already she?s working hard feeding and 
caring for 41 wolves along side Mission: Wolf Director Kent Weber and 
long-term residents Kathy Bennett and Abby Nelson. It is arduous work. They manually 
haul water and many pounds of meat up treacherous snow-covered paths; then 
toss chunks of meat weighing as much as 40 pounds over the tall fences of the 
wolf enclosures. Farmers who have a horse or cow that dies often donate the meat 
for the wolves and roadkill deer can also be used. All need to be picked up 
and transported to the facility, butchered and carefully portioned out so each 
wolf receives the appropriate amount of nutrition. Hernik has helped butcher a 
horse using an axe; something, she says, a city girl like herself has never 
dealt with. She says it was hard for her because she loves horses. Making a fire 
to stay warm, getting used to living without running water and sharing her 
space with mice are also new to her. Maintenance and upgrades at the solar and 
wind powered facility require lots of labor, so repairing fences, helping with 
the construction of a new kitchen and plenty of office work have been part of 
Hernik?s experience as well.</content>
