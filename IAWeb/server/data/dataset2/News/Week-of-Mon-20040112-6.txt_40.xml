  <content>In a letter written to Department 
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Secretary Tommy Thompson, the American 
Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS) has called for an immediate halt on studies 
involving xenotransplantation, the transplanting of organs, cells, and tissues 
from a member of one species into a member of another species. AAVS sent the 
letter to Secretary Thompson in response to a paper published on Jan. 8, 2004, in 
the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal.
The study found that pigs, who had been injected with human stem cells while 
in utero, exhibit pig (porcine), human, and hybrid (porcine/human) cells in 
their organs and blood. This is the first time that cell fusion has been 
observed in live animals. According to the study's authors, Ogle, et al., "the 
hybrids contain the porcine endogenous retrovirus and are able to transmit the virus 
to uninfected human cells." This retrovirus is considered to be a distant 
relative Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV.</content>
