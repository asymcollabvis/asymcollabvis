NEAH BAY -- The TV footage has been replayed over and over again.

A gray whale gliding near the Makah canoe, puffing mist into the air as it
surfaced.

The huge harpoon going in.

The whale recoiling, fleeing.

A speedboat pulling alongside and firing several shots that explode in the
sea.

More harpoons, more shots.

The whale thrashing, rolling.

The harpoon lines going slack. The sea filling with blood.

Now, five years later, intense reaction to the Makah killing its one and
only gray whale since the late 1920s has reverberated with court cases and
environmental requirements -- which have effectively stopped any new whale
hunts since 2000.
...
``It looks like the animal rights people got us where they want us,''
Makah Whaling Commission Vice President Arnie Hunter said in an interview
with the Peninsula Daily News last week.
...
The judges also ruled that a full environmental impact assessment must be
conducted, rather than a less involved environmental assessment, to
determine the impact of whaling on the whale population in the area of the
hunt off the tribe's Neah Bay reservation.

The court was ruling on a lawsuit filed by the Fund for Animals, the
Humane Society of the United States, Washington Citizen's Coastal Alliance
leader Dan Spomer of Sekiu, Chuck Owens of Joyce, co-founder of Peninsula
Citizens for the Protection of Whales, and other groups and individuals.

Whale hunts have also been opposed by some of the 1,800 members of the tribe.
