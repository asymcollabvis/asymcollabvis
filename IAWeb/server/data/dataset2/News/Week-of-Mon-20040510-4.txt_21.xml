TOWN OF ROCHESTER - An emaciated dog who was found on Stony Kill Road has 
been returned to her owner, though charges are still pending in town court. 
   
The 14-year-old female boxer mix was found on Stony Kill Road on April 29 and 
turned over to the dog control officer who in turn brought the canine to the 
Kingston Animal Hospital. Her owner, James A. Baracca, 54, of 8 Stony Kill 
Drive, Accord, was charged April 30 by Ulster County sheriff's deputies with 
misdemeanor failing to provide proper sustenance to an animal. 
Veterinarian Arnold Rugg said Friday that the owner of the dog came to pick 
her up Monday night after calling from the town of Rochester courthouse. He 
said the owners were told the canine needs to be on a high-protein diet and 
antibiotics. Rugg added that the owners seemed to have missed the dog when they 
came to pick her up. He said they hugged her and cried over her.
