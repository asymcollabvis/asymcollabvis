They landed dramatically in the limelight recently after winning -- then 
losing -- a surprising contract in Washington, D.C., but the Humane Society of 
Canada and its CEO have for years found themselves the focus of controversy, 
criticism and legal conflict.
The society's deal to run Washington's animal shelter was cancelled last 
month after a local outcry against the agreement.
Such tension, though it has rarely surfaced publicly, has marked the 
organization's history almost since its birth a decade ago. Founded by the Humane 
Society of the United States in 1993, the Canadian society broke free three years 
later in what one judge referred to as a "purported coup d'?tat" by Michael 
O'Sullivan, the chief executive. The Americans responded with "egregious" 
behaviour themselves, the judge noted.
More recently, some Canadian animal-welfare organizations have said the 
Humane Society of Canada's fundraising efforts -- aided by its highly recognizable 
name -- have diverted funds away from practical projects elsewhere, while the 
Society refuses to lay out exactly where its donations are spent. These 
critics say that the Society has no formal connections with most other humane 
societies in the country and that, while its Revenue Canada filings indicate it 
works solely in Canada, it seems to do much of its work overseas.
"The name [Humane Society of Canada] would lead the public to believe that he 
represents humane societies and that he is the national body, speaking on 
behalf of animal welfare, and yet he's not," complained Bob Van Tongerloo of the 
Canadian Federation of Humane Societies, an umbrella group.
"It's our organization that works with science, with research, with the 
livestock industry, with the federal government, and he's taking in funds that we 
cannot tell are being spent appropriately."
