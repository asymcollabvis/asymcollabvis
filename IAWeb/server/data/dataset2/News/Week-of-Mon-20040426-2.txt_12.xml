Attention Boston dog owners! Councillors Rob Consalvo and James Kelly have
introduced an ordinance that requires residents to register their ?pit
bulls? with the city at a cost of $50 annually. Pit bulls are defined as
American Pit Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American
Staffordshire Terriers, or any mix of those breeds. The measure also
limits residents to two pit bulls and requires owners to leash and muzzle
their dogs when in public. Additionally, owners must display a sign on
their property stating that a pit bull is located on the premises.
Violators will be subject to a $100 fine and the pit bull will be
immediately impounded. Exemptions are provided for animals participating
in contests, shows or exhibitions within city limits, but animals may not
remain for more than two weeks.
...
Breed-specific legislation is opposed by the AKC, the American Veterinary
Medical Association, the National Animal Interest Alliance, National
Animal Control Association, the ASPCA, and a host of national animal
welfare organizations that have studied the issue and recognize that
targeting breeds simply does not work.
