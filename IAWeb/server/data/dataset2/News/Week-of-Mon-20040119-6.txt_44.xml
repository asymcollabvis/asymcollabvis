  <content>Life on Northeast 18th Avenue is slowly returning to normal.

Not long ago, the narrow dirt road was ruled by dogs. People walked, ran or 
stood on the road at their peril - and usually only if they brandished sticks 
or poles or bats or whatever they could find to defend themselves.

For years, according to residents who lived along the road, Robert Freeman's 
mixed breed pit bulls and Labrador retrievers made life "a living hell on 
earth."

"It was miserable," said Mary Alice Smothers, whose 81-year-old mother, Alice 
Broom, was mauled to death by the dogs last month. "Anytime you walk out of 
your door, you did not know what to expect. Sometimes when you opened your 
front door, the dogs would be standing right there."

One neighbor, Susan Fellows, described the dogs as "hungry wolves" and said 
they were a "clear and present danger to the community.

"You constantly had to be on the lookout for them because you never knew 
where they were or when they would strike," Fellows said.

On several occasions, the dogs did strike, often without warning, neighbors 
said.</content>
