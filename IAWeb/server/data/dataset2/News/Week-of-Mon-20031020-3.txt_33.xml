Lopez: What, in your experience, do the "greens" make of you ? a
conservative, Republican-administration vet, sticking his neck out on
animal rights?

Scully: Let me be the first on NRO to break the story that there are
actually other Republicans concerned about cruelty to animals. Outgoing
Senator Bob Smith was a true champion of compassion for animals, but
others remain such as Senator Wayne Allard and Representative Chris Smith.
The same is true in the U.K., where many Tories have favored the abolition
of veal farming, battery cages, fur farming, fox hunting, and hare
coursing among other cruel practices and vicious recreations. As for
environmentalists, I think they generally approve of the book, and I am
glad that I've come to know some of them, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
He is a brave foe of factory farmers, for both environmental and
animal-welfare reasons. I count myself his ally, as do the thousands of
farmers still worthy of that name.

Lopez: When people ? conservatives ? hear "animal rights" they often think
of Peter Singer. Are you in part attempting to get the arguments away from
the likes of Singer?

Scully: I start with a respect for anyone who gives serious attention to
the matter, and to their credit animal rights groups are often the ones
who bring the problems of cruelty to our attention. I think for example of
one group that smuggled a camera into a packing plant a few years ago.
Their footage showed awful things like cows being carved up alive and
squealing pigs being dropped into scalding tanks, which happens every day.
For their efforts, they get derided as meddlesome radicals, crackpots, or
what have you. But I think such people show great courage, and do us a
service.
