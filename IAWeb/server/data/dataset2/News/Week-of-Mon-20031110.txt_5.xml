The contract to operate the District's animal shelter is worth less than $2 
million per year, a tiny fraction of the city's $5.6 billion budget. But when 
District officials dropped the Washington Humane Society and selected a 
little-known Canadian firm for the job, animal-rights groups in town reacted with 
large-scale outrage. 
They bombarded the offices of Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) and the D.C. 
Council with angry telephone calls, flooded their computers with e-mail and showed 
up by the dozens at a public council hearing to denounce the selection. 
Before long, the city canceled the contract with the company and reopened 
negotiations with the local organization, which has operated the shelter for most 
of the past 20 years. 
To Humane Society Executive Director Jody Huckaby, the response was a 
spontaneous outpouring of support for its commitment to the city's animals. 
"We've been here 133 years," Huckaby said. "Generations know our society. 
"It's not like we don't have deep roots in the District. There's a real bond 
and connection there. People really care about the Washington Humane Society." 
But to others, the Humane Society's reemergence raised concerns. Those 
critics contend that the society, supported by deep political connections, has too 
much power and influence, which discourages competitors. 
"I'm one of the many who feel the Washington Humane Society has bullied their 
way back in there," said Mary Rowse, an animal-rights activist who has 
volunteered at area shelters.
