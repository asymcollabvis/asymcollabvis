An endangered Mexican gray wolf from Binder Park Zoo has been on the loose 
since Saturday morning, officials from the Battle Creek zoo said Monday. 
The wolf, along with two others, escaped from their enclosure through a small 
hole they stretched in their exhibit fence early Saturday morning. While two 
wolves were quickly recaptured, one climbed the zoo's 9-foot perimeter fence 
and remains at large. 
Greg Geise, Binder Park Zoo's president and chief executive officer, said the 
missing 19-month-old male wolf was born at the zoo and likely is trying to 
find its way home. The wolf is light gray in color with light brown on the 
bridge of its nose, has fluffy fur on both his face and body, and weighs about 60 
pounds. 
"We are very distressed by this event and are working hard to get the animal 
back," Geise said. "I understand the concerns and anxiety felt by local 
residents and want to assure them that this animal should not be considered a threat 
to them or their families."
