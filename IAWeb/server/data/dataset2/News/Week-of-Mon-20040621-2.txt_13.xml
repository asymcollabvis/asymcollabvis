  <content>Popular low-carbohydrate diets are leading Americans 
to poor health and spawning a rip-off industry of "carb-friendly" products, 
health experts and consumer advocates have said.

They announced a new group, called the Partnership for Essential Nutrition, 
to help educate Americans about the need for healthy carbohydrates such as 
vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grains.

"When unproven science becomes a sales pitch, some people get rich and the 
rest of us get ripped off," Jeffrey Prince of the American Institute for 
Cancer Research told a news conference.

"Eating vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans, which are all 
predominantly carbohydrate, is linked to a reduced risk of cancer, heart 
disease, stroke, diabetes and a range of other chronic diseases."

Prince said low-carb diets that advocate piling on the animal protein and 
fat are "increasing the risk of developing cancer, heart disease, stroke, 
type-2 diabetes and other chronic diseases".

The new group includes such organizations as the Alliance for Aging 
Research, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, the AICR and the 
American Obesity Association.
