  <content>Paris Hilton has joined forces 
with The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in their campaign effort to 
end the infamous Canadian seal hunt, said HSUS. 
Paris was spotted wearing a hooded sweatshirt reading "Club Sandwiches, Not 
Seals" at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. She also urged her 
boyfriend, Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter, to write a letter with her to the 
Canadian Embassy demanding Canada end the hunt. They put their finished letters into 
plastic air sick bags written with the phrase "What's Going on in Canada Will 
Make You Sick." Paris said she is sympathetic to the seal campaign and even 
bought Nick a plush seal toy as a gift when they first met, according to the 
Humane Society of the United States.</content>
