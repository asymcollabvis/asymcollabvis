Common Courage Press has just released the first paperback version of our
1997 book Mad Cow USA, the book that predicted the emergence of the deadly
human and animal dementia disease in the United States. When Mad Cow USA
was first published in November 1997, it bore the subtitle, "Could the
Nightmare Happen Here?" We used a question mark because we thought mad cow
disease was possible but still preventable in the United States, if the
meat industry and government regulators adopted adequate safety measures.

Our book received favorable reviews at the time from some interesting
publications such as the Journal of the American Medical Association, New
Scientist, and Chemical &amp; Engineering News. Otherwise, it went largely
ignored and unheralded. It sold briskly but briefly during the infamous
Texas trial of Oprah Winfrey for the alleged crime of "food
disparagement," and then slid into obscurity until December 2003, when the
"nightmare" in our subtitle arrived and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ann
Veneman announced that mad cow disease has been found in the United States. 
...
The United States must be made to follow the lead of the European Union
nations, ban all feeding of slaughterhouse waste to livestock, and test
millions of cattle for mad cow disease. In the meantime, if you want
American beef that has been grown in a safe manner, search out products
that are certified organic.
