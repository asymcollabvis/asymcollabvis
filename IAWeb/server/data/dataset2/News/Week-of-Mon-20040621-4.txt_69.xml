FORT COLLINS, Colo. - In a close corner of a cattle pen, Temple Grandin
sits on the dusty ground.

Her legs drawn in, her eyes all but shut, she silently waits for nearby
cows to sniff her out. After a few minutes, they draw near. She coaches
a visitor to do the same, until the cattle curiously lick at pant legs
and quietly stare with their blank eyes. In a couple weeks, they?ll be
on the dinner table.

?We?re getting up close and personal with certified Angus beef,? she
says.

An associate professor of animal science at Colorado State University,
Grandin can take more credit than almost anyone for trying to make
modern slaughterhouses efficient and humane.  Once considered curious,
if eccentric, her audits and remodeling of processing plants have set
new standards in the meat industry, which has come to embrace her
message: Give the animals you eat a decent life and a humane death.

?They just walk up there in a quiet line, and they walk up the conveyor
and they?re shot, and it?s over before they know what?s happened,? she
says. ?It?s almost hard for me to believe it works.?

She says this while cutting into a thick steak following an afternoon
spent among cows. For Grandin, eating meat requires accepting where it
comes from and what?s neede to put burger to bun.
