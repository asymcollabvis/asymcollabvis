ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Facing a new Alaska program to hunt wolves from
airplanes, the animal-rights group Friends of Animals is trying to revive
its successful pressure tactic of a decade ago and persuade vacationers to
boycott the state this summer. But tourism officials say this time the
plea seems to be falling mostly on deaf ears.

?It seems for once Outsiders don't care how we do it in Alaska,? said Eric
Downey, vice president of marketing for Denali Lodges.

The Darien, Conn.-based Friends of Animals called for the boycott in
December to protest Alaska's aerial wolf control program. Under the
program, 180 wolves were to be killed this winter in two areas where
residents complain wolves and bears are eating too many moose, leaving
them with too few for food. About 140 wolves have been killed under the
program that ends April 30. The program will resume next winter.
