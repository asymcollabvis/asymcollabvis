One of the stars of the upcoming New Line Cinema comedy "Harold &amp; Kumar Go
to White Castle" is a committed vegetarian.

Not only that, Kal Penn - who plays Kumar in the buddy movie, about a
quest to satisfy an unreasoning craving for dead cow - refused to eat
White Castle beef for the camera, and instead insisted on veggie burgers.

Not only that, Penn - who has agreed, for the sake of Hollywood hype, to
go to Columbus, Ohio, tomorrow to be inducted into something called the
White Castle Hall of Fame - has a brother who works full-time for People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Yesterday, the 26-year-old, New Jersey-born Penn, whose real name is
Kaplen Modi, befitting the son of Hindus from Bombay, told me he plans to
present White Castle execs in Ohio with a PETA-produced position paper
urging the inclusion of veggie burgers on the menu.
