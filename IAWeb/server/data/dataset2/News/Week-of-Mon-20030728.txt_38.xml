Berlin â€” Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who as Soviet leader presided over the troops 
and tanks that guarded the Iron Curtain, now wants a nature reserve along 
the full length of the former cold war border, from Finland to the Adriatic. 
German and other European environmental groups have devised a plan to create 
nature parks out of the no man's land that separated the Soviet bloc from 
the West.

Kept forcibly free of people during more than 40 years of the cold war, the 
border between Eastern and Western Europe became a refuge for plants and 
animals. Construction in the region now threatens these unintentional but 
important nature reserves, environmentalists fear. "Ecology isn't something 
we can only leave to politicians," Mr. Gorbachev, who is president of the 
environmental organization Green Cross International, said when lending his 
support to the project at a recent conference in Bonn.

Environmentalists stress that the reserve would not simply be the area it 
covered or the number of endangered species it contained but also that it 
would link many different groups of organisms, known as biotopes, in the 
longest continuous stretch of undeveloped land left in central Europe.
