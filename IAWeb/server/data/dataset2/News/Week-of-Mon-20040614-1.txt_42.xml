Please don?t ask me why I am a vegetarian. Seriously, don?t ask. I will
give you the most obvious response: I don?t like meat. To that, you are
going to (quizzically) ask me ?why??

See, if I tell you it is for animal rights, then you are going to point
out my leather shoes and the fact that I am eating skittles (gelatin
i.e., horse hooves. Enjoy.) If I was a true vegetarian for animal
rights, you would say that I would be a vegan. And I know that if you
don?t understand vegetarianism, you really don?t understand veganism and
what it takes to get there. Hint: You do it in stages. It just ends in
an argument.
...
My guess is that they think I am an extreme left wing, tree-hugging
environmental activist that is trying to brain wash you to ?my side.?
Not that the profile is completely inaccurate, but for goodness sake,
why would I waste my time trying to ?brainwash? a person when I could
be, I don?t know, shopping or watching TV, both of which are more
productive.

I am not going to tell you why you shouldn?t eat meat, because you
really don?t care. And I am not going to tell you why I don?t,
because
you really don?t care. If it is something you are truly
interested in, you should say ?wow, tell me more about that!? If you
want to argue, be content knowing that I won?t change my mind, and we
can both save our breath.
