Any of the four proposed bills in the Mississippi House of Representatives 
would open a door to a form of deer hunting that many hunters and game managers 
say should not be allowed ? baiting. 
Based on history, any baiting bill faces an uphill battle to complete the 
rocky road to passage. 
In the 2001 legislative session, a bill to legalize baiting made it out of 
the House Game and Fish Committee ? a first ? on a 7-4 vote, but didn't fare 
well when it went to the full House. 
By a 74-44 vote, the House refused to call the bill to the floor for 
consideration. No baiting legislation has made it that far since.
