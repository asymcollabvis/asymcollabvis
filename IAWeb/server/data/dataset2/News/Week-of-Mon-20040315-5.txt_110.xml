  <content>Paul Watson leans back into a fluffy couch
surrounded by swords and confides that his reputation as a crazed,
eco-terrorist pirate actually helps him perform his mission.

He used to have to actually ram and sink whaling ships to be effective,
Watson explains. Now he's considered so dangerous that all he has to do is
show up.
...
Along the way, Watson has earned two wildly different reputations -- one
as the brave cult hero willing to risk his life for endangered animals,
the other as the high-seas vigilante and fatherly mentor to eco-saboteurs
everywhere.

Today, Watson, 53, is perhaps more beloved and reviled than ever. As
Hollywood aims to immortalize him with a movie about his life, critics
cast him as the villain trying to hijack the Sierra Club.

He crashed the country's oldest and largest environmental club last year
by getting elected to its 15-member board. Watson now is widely suspected
of plotting with like-minded animal-rights activists and
population-control advocates to take over the club.

The Farley Mowat is a 46-year-old Norwegian research vessel outfitted with
water guns, a cannon that fires 2-inch balls, and loudspeakers. The sign
in the galley says, "Ocean Warrior." The vegan cook is Alex Cornelissen.

Cornelissen, 35, sold his house and quit his graphics artist job in
Amsterdam, Netherlands, to join Sea Shepherd soon after hearing Watson
speak. He crewed on an anti-whaling run last year to Antarctica and was
later arrested in Japan with Watson's wife for diving into a fishermen's
net and freeing 15 dolphins.

Regrets about hooking up with Sea Shepherd? "It was the best decision I've
made in my life," he says. </content>
