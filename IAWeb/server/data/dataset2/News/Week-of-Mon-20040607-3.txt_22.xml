My neighbor Mike is a 1,000-yard sharpshooter. He has offered his services on 
many occasions to ranchers whose property is overrun by prairie dogs. 
He sets up a platform on his pickup and blasts away 400-700 yards from the 
unsuspecting varmints. It is because the shooter, and therefore the noise, is so 
distant, that the other prairie dogs are not frightened into their holes. It 
allows the population to be reduced. 
He uses what is called a ballistic-tip bullet. It is designed to penetrate 
the skin and immediately expand inside the beast. Death is instantaneous and 
dramatic. The prairie dog explodes like a hand grenade. By professional standards 
it would fit the definition of a humane method of euthanasia: no nervous 
anticipation, no pain, no guilt. 
Which leads me to the wood chipper headline. 
During the recent exotic Newcastle disease outbreak in California, it was 
necessary to destroy hundreds of thousands of chickens, millions of fowl, 
jillions of potential nuggets. The affected birds could not be used for human 
consumption. Imagine if you will, the magnitude of the process and disposal problem.
