The laws are clear: wolf hybrids are illegal in Alaska. And that's got one 
wolf-dog headed for the border... literally. It's part of a deal worked out 
between the State and the animal's owners. 
Sasha is her name, and she's going from the canine equivalent of death row in 
Anchorage, to a sanctuary in Ontario Canada. 
Short of a DNA test, it's tough to tell how much pure wolf a dog's got in 
it's bloodline. So when Sasha got nabbed by officers in Anchorage, they had a 
perfect opportunity to test her. And it was a perfect opportunity to test the 
resolve of those who keep and breed the animals. 
The plan was to put the wolf-dog down, as a deterrent. But that's not what 
ended up happening. 
Sasha is saved. The 3 year old wolf hybrid who was caught after she broke out 
of her Anchorage pen has herself caught a break. Instead of being destroyed 
as scheduled, in a few days she will be shipped 3000 miles to an animal 
preserve in Ontario, Canada. 
"We've actually had more calls on this than the whole wolf/predator control 
thing," said Rick Sinott, a wildlife biologist for the State of Alaska. 
According to Sinnott, that level of public concern might go a long way to 
explaining Sasha's pardon. But Sinnott is quick to say this is the exception, not 
the rule.</content>
