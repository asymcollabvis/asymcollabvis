  <content>Fur is flying in more ways than one in high luxury's 
competitive world.

This time, however, it's off the designer shelves at department stores that 
are making a fortune from rejuvenating a product that was once the domain of 
matrons and the 1980s nouveau riche.

New York luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman, owned by the Neiman Marcus 
Group Inc. (nyse: NMGa - news - people), said on Friday it had struck gold 
with mink-lined rain jackets, shrugs and caplets sold at an in-store shop it 
opened four-and-a-half years ago.

Downstairs, it sells the fur ear-muffs, and leather cuffs with ermine tails, 
on the Christmas list of every fashionista.

"In the first year (2000), we quadrupled sales over the previous year's, so 
we knew we were onto something," Bergdorf Goodman's senior fashion director 
Robert Burke said.

Speaking to Reuters at an International Herald Tribune conference on the 
luxury industry, Burke said sales did not increase in 2001, the year of the 
September 11 attacks.

"That was not a moment for fur," he said. "(But) growth picked up in 2002 and 
this year we are seeing a real, significant increase," he added. "I've never 
seen consumers come back this way."

He said fur accounted for under 10 percent of store sales, but added it was 
not an insignificant amount.</content>
