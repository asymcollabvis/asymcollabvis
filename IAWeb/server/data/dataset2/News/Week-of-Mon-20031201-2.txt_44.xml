SAVING the lives of Australia's injured furry friends can be financially 
draining and without the generosity of Collie businesses, local animal carer Wendy 
Thompson said she could not continue.
Food, milk and vet bills all add up said Ms Thompson, but thanks to a recent 
$1,000 donation from Worsley Alumina she can carry on with her important 
public service for a little longer.
One afternoon last month Ms Thomson received a sick and injured pelican, 
found by Worsley employees at their site during the storms.
Unfortunately, after being cared for by Ms Thompson in her bath tub for 
hours, the pelican died the same evening.
Seeing the vital service Ms Thompson provides and her dedication to the cause 
was enough to prompt Worsley to assist her to save more animals in the 
future. 
"This is a community donation for her service," said Worsley community 
relations officer Kym Betti.
"Sure, she helps us out but she helps heaps of injured animals and community 
organisations out as well."
Hundreds of injured animals have passed through Ms Thompson's home and, after 
being nursed to health, are released back into the wild.
"The animals just love you so much but the hardest thing is letting them go 
because otherwise they'll die," she said.
"If I didn't get assistance from places like Newmart and Worsley I wouldn't 
be able to do it."
Anyone who finds an injured or sick animal can take it to Ms Thompson's home 
at 35 Prinsep Street or phone her on 9734 1058.</content>
