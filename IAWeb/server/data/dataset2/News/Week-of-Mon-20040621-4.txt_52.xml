Fertility techniques that have enabled millions of couples to  have children 
are helping scientists to save endangered species. 
From killer whales and giant pandas to cheetahs and  black-footed ferrets, 
assisted reproductive technology (ART) is allowing  scientists to breed wild 
animals in captivity. 
Dr Wildt is the head of the Department of Reproductive  Sciences at the 
Smithsonian's National Zoological Park. 
He will tell a fertility meeting tomorrow that the  technology allows 
scientists to understand how animals reproduce. 
"We have used ART to understand the reproductive biology of  cheetahs, and 
have learned, for example, that they produce more than 70 per cent  abnormally 
shaped sperm per ejaculate," he said. 
He also says killer whales can be trained to provide daily  urine samples to 
test their hormone levels before artificial insemination  (AI).
