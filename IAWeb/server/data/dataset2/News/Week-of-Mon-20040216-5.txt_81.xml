PROPOSAL: Group ai
Alaskans have been crashing cars and trucks into moose about five or six 
times per day since the start of the year. 
The carnage includes a tragedy near Mile 105 of the Parks Highway on Jan. 5. 
John J. High of Trapper Creek died after his Subaru Legacy smashed into a 
moose with hardly enough time to tap the brakes. A family man survived by his wife 
and two young children, High was driving home from work. 
That same day, drivers near Willow, Sutton, Palmer, Wasilla, Kenai and Seward 
also plowed into moose, according to the Alaska State Troopers. These were 
among more than 230 moose knocked down on rural highways since Jan. 1, about 100 
more than the same period last year. 
At least 16 people have been hospitalized or hurt, while hundreds have limped 
their cars home with dented fenders and shattered glass. 
In Anchorage, where deep snow has driven an estimated 1,000 moose into 
neighborhoods, parks and streets, more than 120 moose have been killed since summer. 
The specter of a huge brown animal lurking at the fringe of headlights 
continues to be the white-knuckle nightmare of every Alaska driver: 1,000 pounds of 
meat and bone threatening to bolt across your path. 
Driving highways becomes a seasonal moose roulette that annually kills one to 
three people and injures at least 100 more. Last March, a 13-year-old boy 
died when a car driven by his mother crashed into a moose dashing across the 
Glenn Highway near the weigh station. 
Even when no one gets hurt, moose collisions cost millions of dollars in 
property damage and lost time, and leaves hundreds of wild animals mangled by the 
roadside. </content>
