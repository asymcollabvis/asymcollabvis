This time the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) has its 
sights set on the Home Secretary for breaking the law by "routinely 
underestimating the level of suffering laboratory animals endure in UK testing 
laboratories."
The Judicial Review proceedings against David Blunkett are backed by a number 
of distinguished experts, with much of the evidence taken from secretly taped 
video footage, which the BUAV claims exposes monkey brain research at 
Cambridge University.
The challenge is the second legal case in a fortnight to be brought against 
the Government in connection with the planned Primate Research Facility.
The BUAV says its investigation shows the Government licenses experiments on 
marmosets under only a "moderate" instead of a more appropriate "substantial" 
suffering banding.
According to the group, Mr Blunkett has ignored obvious suffering such as 
water deprivation and distressing training acts. It says the Government's 
position of underestimating lab animal suffering is morally wrong, serves to mislead 
the public and is also against the law.</content>
