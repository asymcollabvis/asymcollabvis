  <content>Come Wednesday night we'll find out just who has the real 
political muscle at the Legislature -- the hogs or the chickens.

The hogs have the upper hand so far. Rep. Warren Triche's bill that would 
outlaw violent ''hog-dog'' events in which pit bulls are set upon de-tusked boars 
was passed by the House of Representatives 75-25 last week and was sent to 
the Senate, where a procedural effort to derail it was defeated Thursday 
afternoon. 
Rep. Karen Carter's measure to outlaw cockfighting hasn't even had a 
committee hearing yet in the House; and there's a widespread feeling on the House 
floor that it won't get out of the House Agriculture Committee, which is scheduled 
to debate it Wednesday night.

Both bills are aimed at events that various animal welfare groups say are 
barbaric and cruel, but there's a definite dichotomy at work here: Triche only 
got his bill passed after fighting off an attempt to amend the anti-cockfighting 
language into it.
