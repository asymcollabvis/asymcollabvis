New Report Exposes Contractor Bechtel as Threat to Iraqi Environment, Human 
Rights and Basic Services;
U.S. Taxpayers Blindly Funding Post-War Corporate Profiteering and Cronyism, 
Public Interest Groups Say
    
    
Bechtel Group Inc., one of the lead contractors 
in the reconstruction of Iraq, has a 100-year history of capitalizing on 
environmentally unsustainable technologies and reaping immense profits at the 
expense of societies and the environment, said a report released today by Public 
Citizen, Global Exchange and CorpWatch. Its release was timed to coincide with a 
day of direct actions around the country to protest Bechtel?s presence in 
Iraq, the report concludes that the Bush administration must be stopped from 
doling out contracts to undeserving firms with which it has close ties, including 
Bechtel and Halliburton. 
The report, Bechtel: Profiting from Destruction, provides case studies from 
Bechtel?s history of operations in the water, nuclear, energy and public works 
sectors. It documents a track record by Bechtel of environmental destruction, 
disregard for human rights and financial mismanagement of projects that has 
affected communities all over the world and does not bode well for the people of 
Iraq. 
"If environmental and consumer protection violations had been taken into 
account, Bechtel would not have been awarded such an important contract in Iraq," 
said Sara Grusky, senior organizer with Public Citizen. "The American people 
are funding this contract through their tax dollars but are being denied the 
right to see what their money is supporting."
