For four years, Star lived at the end of a length of rope tied to a tree, his 
body covered in fleas, and his ears tattered from fly bites. 
Whether it rained, thundered, snowed or sleeted, Star never got far from the 
tree or a small, filthy doghouse. 

 


He'd watch other dogs go by and stare silently. The owners finally abandoned 
the dog when they moved out, and he was picked up and adopted out by the 
Memphis Animal Shelter. 
Now the husky mix lives in a two-acre pasture with three other dogs and two 
horses. 
"It's hard to believe I've had this baby for over a year," said Kim Jones, 
who renamed him Dexter. "He has got to be the sweetest most appreciative boy 
I've ever seen. You never see him without a toy in tow. He is such a happy boy 
now." 
Most chained dogs don't get to live happily ever after, something that 
bothered Tammy Grimes. 
For six years she lived next door to a chained black Labrador retriever mix. 
She complained to a local humane group in her small town of Tipton, Pa. The 
owner moved the dog to a worse location, at the bottom of a hill. 
"Whenever it rained or snowed, the dog just stood in mud or wet," said 
Grimes. "It was terrible." 
She asked the owner for the dog, they called Worthless, but he always 
refused. 
"I felt so helpless and hopeless so I decided to take a stand and I hoped 
others would, too," said Grimes. 
She founded Dogs Deserve Better in August 2002. The advocacy group is 
dedicated to getting dogs off chains and into homes. 
"Their abuse is much more subtle, no less insidious," said Grimes. "They may 
not be in immediate danger of death. But death of the soul is still death to 
me." 
She managed to get the black dog from its owner and let it live in her house 
for six months until he died of heart failure. </content>
