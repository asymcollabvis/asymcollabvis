In a third-grade class in Ardsley, students rarely bring in unhealthy snacks. 
"They don't want to have to argue with the snack monitor," says their 
teacher, Judy Behrens, who appoints a student inspector each day to judge whether the 
treats pass nutritional muster. 
In the Lakeland school district on the Westchester-Putnam border, 
elementary-school students used to be able to eat hot dogs for lunch every day. Now, the 
nitrate-laced entree is restricted to Mondays. For the rest of the week, 
students can dine on roast chicken, baked potatoes or Caesar salad with grilled 
chicken. Fourth-grader Kevin Reynoso said he's into healthly eating now "so I 
won't die quick" and because "I want to stay skinny for sports." 
The programs are part of a growing effort to quell the epidemic of childhood 
obesity and prevent the health problems it causes. 
Parents who have trouble enough dealing with meals at home worry about what 
their children are eating at school. Some are now working with teachers, 
dietitians and government officials to change school menus, instill lifelong habits 
and teach students to make "healthy choices" based on a balanced approach. The 
lessons begin in kindergarten. </content>
