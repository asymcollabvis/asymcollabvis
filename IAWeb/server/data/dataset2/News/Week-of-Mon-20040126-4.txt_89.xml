   A stranger uses a bow and arrows to kill someone's two Labrador retrievers.
   A city amends an ordinance for the specific purpose of getting one 
particular "exotic" pet to pack his alligator bags and leave town.
   A German shepherd is missing for more than two months after it bolts from 
the care of a paid dog sitter.
   For most people, these events -- all well publicized in Portland area 
media -- provoked feelings of outrage, amusement or sympathy. But to Portland 
pet-law attorney Geordie Duckler, they present the opportunity to advance the 
developing field of pet law.
   "My most famous case is Al the alligator," said Duckler, who was quoted in 
a 2003 New Yorker article entitled "The last meow: How far would you go for a 
pet." He said Beaverton amended an ordinance "solely to go after (my 
client's) alligator, which wasn't a huge alligator."
   With Americans spending more money than ever on their pets -- an estimated 
$31 billion last year, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers 
Association Inc. -- it's not surprising that pet owners, and lawyers, would 
come together.</content>
