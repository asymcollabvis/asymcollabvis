  FYI on the Responsible Pet Owners' Alliance or RPOA in San Antonio-
While the animal control facility, I've personally observed, is far from 
perfect and the city of San Antonio certainly does kill a terrible 
number of animals, there's probably a good reason why the RPOA has been 
ousted- the RPOA is a far right-wing breeder group that ardently opposes 
animal rights and whose motto used to be "preserving our historical 
relationship w/ animals".  
I run Southern Animal Rescue Association - http://www.sarasanctuary.org 
- a sanctuary for dogs, cats, and farm animals, and I have personally 
been the object of vilification by this group's president Mary Beth 
Duerler who has branded me as a radical animal rights activist.  I once 
asked the RPOA for help in rescuing and placing over two hundred dogs 
and cats (purebred of course) from a wretched puppy mill situation near 
San Antonio, they declined and ultimately supported the puppy mill owner.  
SARA is opposed to breeding animals and we promote veganism and for 
those reasons we are considered a threat to the RPOA and to hear them 
tell it all society at large!
The RPOA supports and indeed extolls breeding of dogs and cats as well 
as "boutique pets" like sugar gliders, hedgehogs, reptiles, ferrets, 
etc. They support rodeos and they think that the endangered species list 
should be done away with- among other things.   
I'm certain Animal Defense League and the San Antonio SPCA will do a 
much better job at placing these animals than a bunch of breeders who go 
to the pound to scrounge for those "purebred" dogs and cats while 
allowing the others to be killed.  The ADL and the SPCA help all dogs 
and cats regardless of a ridiculous pedigree.
