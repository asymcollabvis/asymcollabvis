AN organisation which uses dogs and cats as a way of comforting elderly and 
disabled people is calling for more volunteers.
Pets As Therapy was launched in 1983 when founder-member Lesley Scott-Ordish 
decided to help people who had become depressed by being institutionalised in 
care homes and hospitals.
Lena Hanen, director of the South of England branch of PAT, explained: "We 
are a national charity which has around 3,000 to 4,000 volunteers, visiting in 
the region of 100,000 establishments each week.
"Our aim is simple. Where people do not have access to pets, whether that be 
in care homes or elderly people on their own at home, our volunteers can visit 
them with their pets.
"It is instinctive in animals to give love to people, and they cannot care 
less whether those people are in wheelchairs or are elderly.
"The dogs and cats can be a real help to those people as the animals, and 
their owners, are sometimes the only visitors they get, apart from their carers.
"Just seeing a dog or cat can be enough to bring some people out of an 
otherwise withdrawn state."
PAT also takes dogs into schools and prisons where volunteers help teach 
responsible ownership.
Waltham Forest volunteer Carole Heed said: "The animals are very much 
welcomed by the people being visited as many of them have been unable to have their 
pets with them. Also, they will interact with an animal but may not communicate 
with other people. They can be encouraged to use their limbs to stroke them 
or take them for short walks and it has been proved that stroking reduces 
anxiety."</content>
