In the first action of its kind this winter, 18 bison were captured outside 
Yellowstone National Park on Tuesday and were being tested for brucellosis. 
Those that have signs of the disease will be sent to slaughter and the rest 
will be marked and set free, according to Karen Cooper, a spokeswoman for the 
Montana Department of Livestock. 
The bison, a mix of calves, yearlings and adults, were hazed into a pen just 
before noon Tuesday near Horse Butte, west of Yellowstone. The bison were then 
loaded onto trailers and trucked to another holding pen to be tested for 
brucellosis. 
Cooper said some of the bison had been hazed back into the park on Jan. 28, 
Feb. 5 and Feb. 13. 
"These were some of the same animals. We could not get them back in the park 
so today it was a capture operation," Cooper said. 
Several agencies participated in the capture, including the Department of 
Livestock, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, National Park Service and the U.S. 
Forest Service. 
Through a state and federal bison management plan, government agents haze and 
sometimes capture bison that leave Yellowstone. The plan is intended to 
reduce the risk that bison will transmit brucellosis to cattle in the area. 
Captured bison can be sent to slaughter without testing for the disease when 
the population exceeds 3,000, according to the plan. Park officials estimate 
there are currently more than 4,200 bison in the park. </content>
