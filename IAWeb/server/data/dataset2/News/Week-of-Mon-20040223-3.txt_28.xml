Q. My dog was recently diagnosed with pancreatitis. What exactly is this 
disease?
A. Pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas. Severity can range from 
mild to quite severe. The problem occurs less often in cats, most likely due 
to their finicky eating habits. One of the roles of the pancreas is to produce 
enzymes, which aid in the digestion of food in the upper gastrointestinal 
tract. The pancreas becomes inflamed for several reasons, including viral and 
bacterial infections.
The most common cause in dogs is eating foods that are not part of their 
regular diets. Typically, these are table scraps and garbage. Fatty foods are the 
worst. The disease is often seen around the holidays or family gatherings in 
which pets are fed leftovers. Current nutritional recommendations are to feed 
pets diets specifically formulated for them. Their gastrointestinal tracts 
become accustomed to a constant diet and any deviations can lead to pancreatitis. 
Changing dog food should be done gradually over a few days.</content>
