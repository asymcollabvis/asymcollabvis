With its huge oil portraits of beatific steers, The Broiler Steakhouse in
downtown Sacramento is a shrine to beef. In the kitchen, Chef Lalo
Valenzuela proudly lofts a 35-ounce porterhouse -- a marbled wonder and
the restaurant's biggest cut -- and considers the impact of the recent mad
cow scare on the public palate.

"Last weekend," he said, "we sold a half-dozen of these. We had one party
of 27, and 26 of them ordered New York steaks. Overall, we thought we'd
see more effect from mad cow, but so far it hasn't materialized."

Valenzuela's comment mirrors the observations of restaurant owners and
food economists nationwide, who find the American public isn't panicking
over the discovery last month of a mad-cow-infected Holstein in Washington
state. People are wary, they say, but not hysterical.

Mark Livener, 35, was walking out of Johnny Rockets, a 1950s-style diner
in Downtown Plaza, after sharing a burger with his 7-year-old son, Jake.
He said that making the next showing of "Lord of the Rings" was on his
mind, not mad cows.

"I took a bigger risk driving over here than eating that hamburger,"
Livener said as he and Jake rushed to the theater. "Why should I give up
meat over one sick cow?"
...
"The way meat is raised in this country is a horror show," said Paul
Cultrera, Sacramento Natural Foods Co-Op general manager. "A lot of our
customers for years have told us they are vegetarian because they don't
want to support the industrial meat machine."
