A previously unknown animal rights group on Friday claimed
responsibility for bombing the Emeryville offices of Chiron and
suggested in a brazen communique that it will target the homes of the
biotech company's workers.

The FBI branded Thursday morning's twin bombings an act of domestic
terrorism and is investigating whether the group, which calls itself
the ``Revolutionary Cells'' and the ``Animal Liberation Brigade,'' is
indeed responsible for the attacks.

``You might be able to protect your buildings, but can you protect
the homes of every employee?'' said the statement, which was
anonymously e-mailed to other animal rights organizations and posted
on their Web sites.

The statement went on to call for ``animal liberation through armed
struggle'' and compared the group to others in the Middle East and
Northern Ireland whose ``struggle will continue until all of the
oppressive institutions are destroyed!''
...
Experts who track environmental and animal rights organizations say
that the tone of Friday's communique is far more militant then what
has been seen in the past.

``It sounds like a communist anarchist animal rights group,'' said
Gary Perlstein, a Portland State University criminologist. ``I think
Chiron should take the threat seriously. They are no longer dealing
with little elves in the woods and pranksters. They are starting to
deal with true militant revolutionaries.''
...
Steven Best, an associate professor of philosophy at the University
of Texas-El Paso, agrees that the animal rights movement's more
militant fringes have stepped up their activity.

``I've never seen the phrase `animal liberation through armed
struggle' before,'' said Best, who studies radical politics. ``The
fact that it was a bombing and not arson shows an escalation not just
of rhetoric but tactics.''
