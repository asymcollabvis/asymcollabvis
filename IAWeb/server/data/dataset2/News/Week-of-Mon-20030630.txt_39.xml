Subject: FW: Clownfish Commentary and Nemo Critique by Snorkel Bobh

Clownfish Calamity


or



Murky Water on the Showbiz Reef





             Finding Nemo is Disney’s latest bid for another billion bucks,
and the Devil gets his due for some solid social messages on a most
impressionable audience. Too bad the debilitating burden falls yet again on
species of a lesser greed.

             That is, Disney learned the hard way with 101 Dalmatians that 
a
multi-million dollar cartoon will result in a huge demand for the cartoon
characters. 101 stimulated dog breeders and puppy mills to pump thousands 
of
Dalmatian pups in time for Xmas (the season of giving, don’t you know). By
May, animal shelters across the country were swamped with gangly,
high-energy Dalmatian turn-ins that just weren’t working out. Many were in
estrus. Many were put down.

             Of course Disney could not have predicted this dire 
consequence
of a lovable cartoon the first time around. Given the experience of 101,
however, Disney did know, yet maintained a stonewall oblivion on the reef
carnage potential of Nemo. If Disney did not foresee the carnage, then
Disney could have stepped up and spoken on behalf of reef fish around the
world. Yet not one talk bubble has yet broken the surface from the 
Corporate
Megalith now shaping the mindset and behavior of young America. As my
longtime friend and snorkel buddy Matt Roving put it, “Forty million on
promotion and not one dime in tribute.” Disney culpability is palpable and
exasperating.
