A team of at least 80 investigators yesterday intensified the probe of
last week's $20 million arson fire in University City, and officials say
they hope to know within days how the fire was set.
...
The investigation is focusing on the militant group Earth Liberation
Front, said Dan Dzwilewski, the FBI's special agent in charge of the San
Diego office. A banner reading "If you build it, we will burn it," with
the initials "E.L.F.," was found at the site Friday. An e-mail sent from
the group to The San Diego Union-Tribune later that day stated the banner
"is a legitimate claim of responsibility by the Earth Liberation Front."
...
At the scene yesterday, reaction to the fire was mixed.

"I think it's a positive statement that at least someone somewhere is
trying to point out that the overdevelopment is clogging our already
congested urban areas," said Richard Marose, 41, a restaurant manager who
lives in a nearby apartment complex. 
...
"I'm all for protecting the environment, but not in a way like that,"
Olson said. "It could have easily spread to the apartments. It could have
killed many people with only a change in the wind."

Authorities are urging anyone with information about the fire to call the
FBI at (858) 565-1255, or Crime Stoppers at (619) 235-8477. 
...
Marose said ATF agents contacted him at home Sunday night. He said he
didn't know why and had refused to talk to them.

Marose said he had nothing to do with Friday's fire.

Asked about the potential for death or injury in the fire, Marose said,
"That's the price of war: collateral damage. . . . This is a war to
protect the environment, to raise the consciousness of people."

Marose was not alone in his views.

A small hand-printed sign taped to a nearby traffic barrier read:

"Thank-You E.L.F. Burn Baby Burn."
