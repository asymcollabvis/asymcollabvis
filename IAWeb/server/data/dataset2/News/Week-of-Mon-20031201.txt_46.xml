Remember your best friends at Christmas time with gifts from the shelter's 
pet shop. A nice selection of dog and cat toys, and rawhide treats at reasonable 
prices are in stock. One gift suggestion is a new matching leash and collar; 
for an additional $1 get a computerized identification tag. As long as lost 
pets are wearing theID tag, the shelter can reunite them with their owners by 
looking up corresponding information in the SPCA computer files. It may someday 
prove to be the best gift ever. 
For the animal lovers on your list, check out the new supply of SPCA 
sweatshirts, animal board games, or memberships and receive our newsletter, "Kennel 
Klippings." </content>
