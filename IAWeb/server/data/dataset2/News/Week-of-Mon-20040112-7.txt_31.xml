  <content>The long, stringy fingers of hydrilla that entwine props, gobble up 
baits, and clog the boat roads, making them virtually impassable, has beaten a 
hasty retreat thanks to the bitterly cold temperatures. 

A quick survey of Iatt Lake, a pristine 7,100-acre lake, belies the fact this 
lake, located in Grant Parish, has a tremendous grass problem. It's a problem 
that is slowly turning a fine fishing lake into a giant puddle of water. 

While there is no visible sight of the alligator weed or hydrilla, the 
obnoxious weed lies just inches below the surface, out of sight, waiting for 
spring-like temperatures that will allow it to multiply and spread. 

"It is as bad as I have seen it," said Wendell Young, who has a camp on the 
lake. "I'm 65 years old and I have been fishing this lake since I got out of 
the Marine Corps in 1960. I can't recall it ever being worse." </content>
