  <content>Beluga caviar, pearly black and $1,500 a pound, goes 
well with Champagne. But next year, connoisseurs may have to do with farmed 
American caviar or lesser Caspian species if the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service decides to ban imports.
At issue is the number of beluga sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. Some 
researchers say the sturgeon, a 200-million-year-old species, is in serious trouble. But 
in September, the Geneva-based Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, known as Cites, announced that numbers of 
beluga sturgeon rose to 11.6 million from 9.3 million from 2001 to 2002, 25 
percent. The figures were supplied to Cites by Russia's Caspian Fisheries 
Research Institute in Astrakhan, once the country's caviar capital.</content>
