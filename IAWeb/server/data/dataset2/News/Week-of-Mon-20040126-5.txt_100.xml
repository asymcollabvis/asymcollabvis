Dino the dog wasn't just another handsome face. He got the acting job because 
of his ability to release a squirt bottle trigger with his paw.

Dino's new life - more glamorous than his old one in the Las Vegas pound - is 
now focused on helping to sell fabric deodorizer. The cute mixed-breed is 
featured in "Dogs and More Dogs," a public television NOVA show that show 
celebrates man's best friend.

"Dogs" (airing 8-9 p.m. EST Tuesday Feb. 3; check local listings) is a fun, 
eclectic combination of whimsical cartoons and science with an added dash of 
humanity thrown in to remind viewers just why people love dogs so much. It 
explores dogs' genetic origins and the biology behind floppy ears, curved tails, 
spotted coats, short legs, long snouts and other canine traits.

"I think the most adorable thing is just all the dogs. The extraordinary, the 
most interesting thing is the science of it, how in the world the dogs become 
the varied species, how their roles become specialized genetically," show 
host John Lithgow said in a telephone interview. The actor is a self-proclaimed 
dog lover who walks his own 7-year-old Australian blue merle shepherd, Blue, 
every day in New York's Central Park.</content>
