In Belvidere, a 34-year-old mare named Molly folds to her knees in the shade 
of a tree and dies. Her owner feels guilty paying someone $250 to take her 
carcass away but at least knows Molly died at home on her terms. 
In Colorado, a teenage Appaloosa named Delilah has proven incorrigible. She?s 
unruly, even dangerous. Her owner takes her to an auction knowing that 
Delilah probably is headed to a slaughterhouse. 
The stories happened years apart, several states apart, to two horse owners 
who will never know each other and, if put together in a room, would consider 
the other an alien species. 
So it is with the question of what to do with old horses. 
Horse lovers are divided: Put the animal out of its misery? Let it die on its 
own? Send its body to a rendering plant where it will be turned into pet food 
or cosmetics? Or have it slaughtered for someone?s dinner in Europe? 
Now, the debate has made its presence known in the Rock River Valley in the 
form of two 12-by-25-foot billboards, one on Riverside Boulevard in Loves Park, 
the other on Illinois 120 in Woodstock, that decry slaughtering horses for 
people to eat. 
?Keep America?s Horses In The Stable And Off the Table!? they read. 
The billboards? sponsor, a Pennsylvania-based group called the Equine 
Protection Network, chose the Rockford area because it?s close to DeKalb, home to one 
of three slaughterhouses in the country that sell horse meat overseas for 
food.
