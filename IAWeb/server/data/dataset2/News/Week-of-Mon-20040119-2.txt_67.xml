The arrow-pierced Canada goose rescued from a Reno lake last Friday has died 
from its injuries, officials said Tuesday.
And a local hunter has come forward to admit that he believes he shot the 
fatal arrow while legally hunting in Lockwood along the Truckee River, but he 
thought he had missed, officials said.
The bird ? with an arrow protruding from its chest ? apparently had flown 
some five miles from Lockwood to the lake in the South Truckee Meadows, where it 
remained for more than a week before its rescue.
The arrow was removed at a Sparks veterinary hospital, but the goose died 
Saturday night, officials said.
?The stress was apparently too much for it,? said Chris Healy, spokesman for 
the Nevada Department of Wildlife. ?It didn?t make it.?</content>
