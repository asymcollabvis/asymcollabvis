Here's a new twist to the old chicken vs. egg de bate: On the production
line, the egg has to come first, but thanks to new animal-care standards,
a chicken's lot in life is looking decidedly better.

A few area producers have adopted new nationally developed animal-welfare
guidelines that promote better living conditions for egg-laying hens. They
say the results have been remarkable.

"We got larger eggs, and more of them," said Paul Sauder, the
third-generation president of Sauder's Quality Eggs in Lititz, which
recently applied the standards with a test flock. "The chickens were
significantly healthier, and their laying lives were extended. In every
indicator, the hens kept under the new animal-care standards were nothing
less than amazing." 

Sauder's did away with beak-trimming, which was designed to prevent
cannibalism, and began maintaining air quality in the chickenhouse at a
higher standard. The chickens were fed during a resting period in which
food was sometimes withheld.

The egg producer also reduced the number of hens it housed in each cage
from nine to seven. 
...
Based on scientific research conducted over two years by an independent
advisory committee commissioned by United Egg Producers, the animal-care
standards for hens have still received criticism for not going far enough.

Animal-rights groups want to abolish the practice of beak-trimming, among
other concerns.

Sauder's and other companies market free-range eggs for consumers with
ethical concerns, but those cartons cost up to three times as much as eggs
from caged chickens. And Sauder notes that free-range birds are less
protected against disease. </content>
