In addition to supervised probation, Peplin-Sobelman must pay about $26,000 
in restitution to the Humane Society, which paid for the care of animals 
rescued from the breeding operations. Peplin-Sobelman will not be allowed to breed 
animals again or keep more than three house pets, said St. Francois County 
Prosecuting Attorney Wendy Horn. 

Horn called the case "a horrible crime" and "the most egregious case of 
animal abuse" she has ever seen. 

In February 2002, police found 26 living and eight dead cats in a trailer 
owned by Peplin-Sobelman. Investigators said the animals were left unattended for 
weeks. Many survived by drinking melted snow that leaked through the 
trailer's roof and by eating one another. Three of the rescued cats later died from 
diseases associated with malnutrition. 

Weeks later, police discovered an unlicensed dog-breeding facility operated 
by Peplin-Sobelman. There, authorities found 155 dogs and seized 30 animals 
suffering from ailments often associated with neglect. 

Dan Paden, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said 
the sentence "would be laughable if it was not so abhorrent."
