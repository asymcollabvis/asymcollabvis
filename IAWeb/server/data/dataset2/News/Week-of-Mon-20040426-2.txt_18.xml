In a series of precise, swift, vertical motions, junior in engineering Jon
Fisher drove his cleaver through a ginger root ? the rhythm of his
chopping echoing throughout the kitchen. He then slid the knife under the
minced vegetable and set it aside to begin slicing through a thick brick
of tofu.

"I'm pressing the tofu to increase moisture in the crevices," Fisher told
an onlooker as he squeezed the grayish-white cube between his palms.

Fisher participated in the second Vegetarian Iron Chef competition held
Tuesday night in the Bevier Hall cafeteria. The event, based on a popular
television program, featured two teams of eight student and community
chefs. The teams, representing Campus Vegetarian Society (CVS) and the
Common Ground Food Co-op, competed to create dishes revolving around a
secret ingredient.
