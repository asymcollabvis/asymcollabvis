What exactly is it that vegetarians eat?

That's a question asked by researchers in the American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition, who then reported on those who eat no meat, poultry or fish.

Or, at least profess that they do.

It turns out that a number of people who report being vegetarians actually
consume meat, poultry and fish regularly. They just eat these foods less
often than the rest of the nation's omnivores.

In a study of daily food records from more than 13,000 Americans, Loma
Linda University researchers discovered that fewer than 1 percent of those
surveyed (including self-described vegetarians) ate no animal flesh.
...
It's commonly understood that vegetarians don't eat meat, poultry or fish.
Lacto-ovo vegetarians eat some dairy products and eggs. Vegans, on the
other hand, eschew all animal products, whether from land or sea,
including dairy products, plus clothing made from wool, silk and leather.
"There aren't many of those in the United States," says Hasso-Haddad.

The study found that people who consider themselves vegetarian -- no
matter how strictly they actually avoid animal products -- appear to eat
more healthfully than their omnivorous counterparts. For example,
self-described vegetarians followed diets lower in total fat, saturated
fat and cholesterol. They also consumed more fiber and fruit than the
meat-eaters. Strict vegetarians -- that group of less than 1 percent --
consumed more grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit and wine than other
self-described vegetarians.
