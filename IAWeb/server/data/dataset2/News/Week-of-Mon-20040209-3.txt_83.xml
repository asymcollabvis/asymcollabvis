Sophie Trollope's "cry wolf" is not a false alarm - it is a serious cry to 
protect the animals she so loves, leading her to become an expert in wolf 
behaviour.

She is fighting for the rights of wolves across the globe, and educating 
people about keeping wolf-dogs as pets.

"I started my research on wolf-dogs in 2001. There seem to be several 
thousand wolves in South Africa. Some of these are used for breeding with normal 
dogs, creating the wolf-dog," she said.

Speaking from her Waterkloof home, Trollope recalled how she visited a wolf 
sanctuary, Wolf Park, in the US.

'I had to stand quiet, let a wolf 'choose' me...'
"I have always loved animals. In 1992 I was going through a difficult time 
and I received a husky, Tessa, as a Mother's Day present. She had been abused by 
her previous owner. I only had her for five months before she died," Trollope 
said.

Trying to cope with this loss, she started to collect articles on animals and 
their behaviour. She wanted to prove to herself that Tessa did not die in 
vain after an unhappy life. The following year she went to an animal behaviour 
seminar and saw a video of Wolf Park.
