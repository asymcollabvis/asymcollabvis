This holiday season, The Green Guide 
offers its first annual round up of authentic eco-products -- and those to 
avoid. Choosing from 12 categories, ranging from soap to automobiles, the Guide 
has selected top product picks from each to help consumers ease environmental 
impacts and adopt a healthier lifestyle. "This issue is in response to reader 
demands for a one-stop guide to products that it's currently most important to 
buy green for the sake of the environment and our health," says editor Mindy 
Pennybacker. During The Green Guide's first decade of publication, the 
organic-food market has grown by an average 20 percent a year, and reliable ecolabels 
have come into being for other items, such as wood and paper. Yet not all 
labels are reliable, and well-meaning consumers feel pressured to make sweeping 
lifestyle changes. The Green Guide has stepped in to help sort through claims and 
suggests a few choices one can make in daily life, right now, that will have 
far-reaching impacts on the marketplace. According to a recent poll, 69 
percent of subscribers have purchased a product or service after reading about it in 
The Green Guide, which accepts no advertising. To help readers further, "We 
plan to publish this top products guide annually," says publisher Wendy Gordon.
