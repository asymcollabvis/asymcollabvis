IBERIA -- An official with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says 
the organization has received numerous complaints concerning a plan to use a 
homemade gas chamber to kill problem dogs in Iberia.

The police policy in Iberia had been to shoot vicious dogs. When that policy 
came under fire earlier this year, city officials moved to develop a program 
to gas dogs deemed dangerous by police. 
That solution has not been popular with some people.

"Our doctor called the Iberia mayor because we have been inundated with calls 
from people outraged over the shootings in Iberia," said Daphna 
Nachminovitch, director of PETA's Domestic and Wildlife Rescue and Information Department 
in West Virginia. "We share their concern about the city's movement to use a 
carbon monoxide gas chamber to kill dogs."

In the last several months, the small rural town of 650 located at the 
crossroads of Highways 42 and 17 in Miller County has been overrun with packs of 
stray dogs. The dogs have been credited with numerous attacks on residents, 
rummaging through trash and causing problems. 

Mayor Bob Crawford said the town has been forced to shoot dogs in at least 
three cases where residents or police had been attacked.
