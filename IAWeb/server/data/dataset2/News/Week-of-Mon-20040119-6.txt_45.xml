With more than 30,000 fast-food restaurants in 121 countries around the 
globe, the company that milkshake-mixer salesman Ray Kroc bought from two 
California brothers named Dick and Mac McDonald is more than a mere restaurant chain.

For some people, it's a symbol - a symbol of American reach and power, of 
American arrogance, of the dominance and crassness of American culture, of the 
evils of globalization. 

Yes, lots of folks love to hate McDonald's - and it's not necessarily the 
food that gets them so worked up. It's the very idea of a worldwide fast-food 
chain.

McDonald's restaurants have been picketed and set on fire in France. 
Animal-rights activists have set fires at some McDonald's restaurants in America. 
Around the world, the home of the Big Mac is a frequent target of 
anti-globalization protesters and a symbol of much that is "wrong" with America.

And that kind of nonsense, folks, is what makes Joan Kroc's bequests to the 
Salvation Army and, earlier, to National Public Radio so sweet - or at least as 
satisfying as a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

Ray Kroc died in 1984 and his wife, Joan, inherited an estate then valued at 
$2 billion. And now Joan, who died in October, has left $1.5 billion to the 
Salvation Army, one of the largest individual gifts to charity ever made.</content>
