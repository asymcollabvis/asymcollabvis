  <content>Home, home on the range, where the deer and the 
antelope play, eat shrubs, cause traffic jams and give birth on your front 
lawn. 
Whether it is deer in Montana, black bears in New Jersey, mountain lions in 
California or bison in Wyoming, wildlife is becoming accustomed to city life, 
sometimes with tragic results. 
In Helena, Montana, up to 500 mule deer live within the city limits, and 
their number is growing. 
"We have 25-50 fawns born each year," said Mike Korn, the area supervisor for 
Montana's Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. 
Development and urban sprawl are partly to blame. 
"We've actually moved into their territory, rather than vice versa," said Ron 
Aasheim, administrator of conservation education for the department. 
Drought conditions and wildfires in the last five years are other factors. 
"In some areas, towns and cities are the only green spots," Korn said. 
Environmental laws have sometimes been too effective. New Jersey's black 
bears were hunted nearly to extinction before a 33-year hunting ban led to a 
population explosion. 
In Montana, mule deer numbers are growing in its cities as the urban 
environment provides ideal habitat. 
"Food, shelter, lack of predators -- the deer have everything they need," 
Aasheim said. 
Last month, northern California officials were shocked to find a sea lion in 
a farmer's field about 65 miles inland. The 315-pound creature had traveled 
about 1 mile from the nearest body of water, a series of canals crisscrossing 
the farmland. </content>
