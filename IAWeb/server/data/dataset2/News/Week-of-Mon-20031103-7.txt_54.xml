The Jezer house in Tully has an equal opportunity kitchen.

Rhea Jezer, two-time Democratic candidate for Congress and environmental
advisor to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, does most of the day-to-day
cooking for the family, which includes three grown children and five
grandchildren.
...
"Rabbi Danny Jezer is one hell of a vegetarian cook," says family friend
Donald Siegel, a professor of earth sciences at Syracuse University. "I
had dinner at his house for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, as I do every
year, and the food was terrific."
...
"A higher form of being kosher is vegetarianism."

An even higher form might be becoming a vegan, a vegetarian who eats no
animal products. Jezer isn't ready to call himself either.

"I do not claim to be a vegetarian because I do eat fish," he says. And he
enjoys milk, cheese and other dairy products.

"I have no problems eating dairy. It's not killing an animal. I'm not a
vegan." 
...
"She does a superb job," says her husband. If you know a cook who really
stands out or would like to nominate yourself, write to: "Cook of the
Week," CNY, The Post-Standard, P.O. Box 4915, Syracuse, NY 13221. Please
be sure to include a name, address and daytime telephone number.
