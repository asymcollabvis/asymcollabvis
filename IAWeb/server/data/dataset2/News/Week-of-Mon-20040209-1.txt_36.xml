Animal-liberationists force medical research on the backburner.
...
The anti-human values that permeate the animal-rights/liberation movement
are, once again, vividly on public display. Cambridge University, under
pressure from animal liberationists, recently announced it has dropped a
proposed multimillion-pound research project that would have, in part,
conducted experiments on monkeys in the urgent search for the causes of
and cures for devastating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, Huntington's, and stroke.
...
The Silver Springs Monkey Case appears to have been the brainchild of Alex
Pacheco, cofounder of PETA with Ingrid Newkirk, and like her, an
"animal-rights" fanatic who believes that animals are equal to people.
"The time will come," he once stated, "when we will look upon the murder
of animals as we now look on the murder of men."
...
Tremendous human suffering can be eliminated as a result of the proper and
humane use of animals in medical research. Of necessity, this must in some
cases include primates, which are indispensable in the development of an
HIV/AIDS vaccine, research into malaria, hepatitis B and C, and the
development of promising therapies to treat devastating neurological
conditions.

But animal liberationists could care less. And it isn't just about
monkeys. As far as they are concerned, better your grandmother die slowly
of Alzheimer's disease than allow any animals to be used in crucial
medical research.</content>
