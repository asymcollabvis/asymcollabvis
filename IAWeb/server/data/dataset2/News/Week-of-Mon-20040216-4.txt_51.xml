n recent years, psychologists and other health professionals have made us 
realize that our health depends largely on our behavior. Eating soy, it now 
appears, is one of the simplest things we can do to boost our health. 
Once revered as a sacred crop in China, soybeans are one of the richest plant 
sources of protein. In fact, the World Health Organization considers it on 
par with meat and dairy proteins. But not only is this low-fat dietary protein 
great news for vegetarians or dieters, a growing body of research indicates 
that soy may help prevent many chronic diseases. Many of its therapeutic benefits 
are believed to come from its vast stores of isoflavones. These bioactive 
plant chemicals function like weak estrogen--a female hormone necessary for 
normal growth and development--by adjusting the hormone's effects when levels are 
too high or low.
To get the most out of soy, health experts suggest eating whole foods like 
tofu, soymilk and tempeh because they contain higher levels of isoflavones than 
processed foods or supplements. Fortunately, there are now a variety of soy 
and tofu products that are both convenient and tasty. Soymilk can be found 
nationally in refrigerated sections of supermarkets, and it easily replaces cow's 
milk for both drinking and cooking.</content>
