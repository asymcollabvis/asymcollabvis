The Doris Day Animal Foundation (DDAF) is encouraging Americans to be 
"PETriotic" by having their pets spayed or neutered to participate in the tenth 
annual SPAY DAY USA, on Tuesday, February 24, 2004. DDAF is the nonprofit organizer 
of Spay Day USA, the national campaign to reduce pet overpopulation that has 
been responsible for altering more than one million cats, dogs, and other 
animals since its inception. 
The public can participate in Spay Day USA by having their pet altered, by 
making a donation or by volunteering at a local event. "Spay Day USA is a 
wonderful example of how individuals and communities across the nation can work 
together to make a difference in the lives of animals and people," said Doris Day, 
DDAF's founder and president. To find the Spay Day USA event nearest you, 
visit www.pets911.com, or call 1-888-PETS-911 (in Spanish and English). 
Animals who have been spayed or neutered usually enjoy better health and make 
more desirable companions than those who have not been altered. In addition 
to benefiting animal guardians and their pets, spay/neuter benefits communities 
by not adding to the number of homeless animals burdening local humane 
shelters and U.S. taxpayers, who pay more than $1 billion annually to deal with the 
problem of pet overpopulation. "Spay/neuter is a PETriotic thing to do," says 
Holly Hazard, DDAF's executive director," because when we take care of our 
pets, we are helping our communities." </content>
