Sasha, 17, a female African lion, will be moved to the zoo hospital holding 
area while the feline house is rebuilt



Ace, age 11, a male cheetah, spends the time in the lion house before moving 
to temporary quarters.



The doors to the lion house will close Monday and aren't scheduled to reopen 
until July 2005.
While most of the 18 big cats that live in the building will be relocated 
temporarily, Colleen, Rocky, a snow leopard named Tankh and four caracals will be 
leaving the zoo for good, said Bess Frank, the zoo's curator for large 
mammals, on Saturday.
After these moves, the Milwaukee County Zoo will have no caracals or cougars. 
However, once the renovations are complete, the zoo plans to replace a lion 
and a jaguar that died last year with at least two new lions and two new 
jaguars.</content>
