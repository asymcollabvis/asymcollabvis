An Internet story has been sent out to many pet breed memberships and
animal support group Web sites and mailing lists concerning the Swiffer
Wetjet.

The story alleges that the Swiffer Wetjet contains harmful chemicals
that can kill a pet due to liver failure. I have received telephone
calls, letters and e-mails as to whether the story is true. The answer
is no.
...
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
weighed in on the issue, and is working with the parent company Proctor
and Gamble to dispel the e-mail's unfounded allegation. According to the
ASPCA's Animal Poison Control Center, the Swiffer WetJet System contains
water (90-100 percent), propylene glycol n-propyl ether and isopropyl
alcohol (1-4 percent).
