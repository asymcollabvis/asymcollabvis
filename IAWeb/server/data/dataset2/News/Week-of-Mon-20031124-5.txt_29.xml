  <content>The fourth-graders at Sunnyvale School love their class
hamster. And their health teacher, Jane Wheeler, wants them to hate
cigarette smoke.

So she brainstormed this idea: When she teaches about tobacco, she rests
the children's furry friend in a gallon jar. Then she lights an off-brand
cigarette shoved into the top of an empty dish-soap bottle. She squeezes
the bottle, the cigarette tip glows red, and smoke wafts into the jar for
maybe half a minute.

The hamster winces and rubs her tiny eyes. Wheeler rescues the rodent and
asks her students in Classroom 139: What does this tell us about smoking?

She's done the demonstration for five or six years in front of 60 or so
students each year. No one ever complained.

Then a Sunnyvale mom tipped off People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
...
Having heard that this year's demonstration was scheduled for last week,
Magee-Cain decided something should be done. She e-mailed PETA.
...
On Nov. 19 at 1 p.m., PETA faxed Sunnyvale principal David Greer.

At 3 p.m., PETA left him a voice mail.

At 5 p.m., PETA posted on its Web site an update marked "Urgent!" A
Sunnyvale teacher, the item read, is "planning to conduct a cruel
classroom experiment in which a hamster is placed in a clear container
without ventilation and smoke is pumped into the chamber."
...
The National Science Teachers Association encourages teachers to have
animals in the classroom: They invigorate textbook lessons with real life.
