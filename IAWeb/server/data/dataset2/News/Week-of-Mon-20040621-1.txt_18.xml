There was a time when vegetarians and other healthconscious eaters were
forced to carry coolers loaded with food from home when they traveled
almost anywhere in the United States. But the world has changed, and
anyone who has driven the interstate lately knows that even there, one
can nearly always find something reasonably nutritious and satisfying to
eat.

McDonald's and other fastfood establishments include a variety of salad
meals and sandwiches that are lower in fat and calories than their main
selections, but still filling and rich in flavor.
...
Even those who want to dine and shop vegetarian and organic on the road
now have choices. A new paperback guide, "Healthy Highways: The
Traveler's Guide to Healthy Eating," by Nikki and David Goldbeck, the
authors of "The Supermarket Handbook" and "American Wholefoods Cuisine,"
is a good companion as you make your way across the 48 and even up to
Alaska or across the sea to Hawaii.

One of the Goldbecks' goals is to encourage existing restaurants to
provide a broader range of menu items, including vegetarian options. For
example, in various cities in California, where many healthful food
trends originate, there is a chain of family restaurants, Hobee's, that
caters to nearly every taste, from bacon and fries to tofu and brown
rice, the authors write. For those seeking more healthful fare, Hobee's
selections include whole-wheat pancakes, homemade and mostly vegetarian
soups, veggie and turkey burgers and even soy milk.
