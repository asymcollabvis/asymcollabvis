MIDVALE -- The FBI has seized a fax machine from a University of Utah
health clinic it says was used to announce a claim of responsibility for
a lumberyard fire under investigation as a possible act of ecoterrorism.

The group, called the Earth Liberation Front, claimed in a fax to a Salt
Lake City news station Tuesday that it set Monday's fire in West Jordan
that caused $1.5 million in damage.

FBI agents traced the fax to the Greenwood Health Clinic, special agent
Bob Wright said Friday.

The FBI took the clinic's fax machine Thursday, and sent it to the
agency's crime lab in Washington.

There, Wright said the bureau will conduct a number of DNA, fingerprint
and microscopic analyses.
