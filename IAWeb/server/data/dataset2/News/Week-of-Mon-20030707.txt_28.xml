Shriners Physically Attack Activists
 
Over two dozen animal rights activists peacefully protested the Shriners' 
abuse of animals through circuses (see www.Circuses.com) today at their national 
convention in Minneapolis.  We were decked out in Sad Clown costumes and held 
signs with slogans such as "Shrine Circus = Animal Abuse" as well as posters 
with pictures of animals tortured in circuses.
 
We were surprised at the large number of Shriners (who all looked like they 
were about to give birth) hurling insults and swearing at us.  Some examples 
follow:
 
1.  One Shriner repeatedly called us "Mother f-ckers", with NO provocation.
2.  A group of Shriners called female activists "dykes" and told us to "use 
this" while waving a plastic, penis-shaped cigar holder in our faces and making 
sexual gestures with it;
3. Shriner after Shriner called us "assholes", told us to "get a job" and 
otherwise insulted us;
4. Shriner after Shriner, when asked by a 7 year-old boy if they would take a 
flier, told him "go to hell", "you're sick", and "asshole" (some love for 
children, huh?);
5.  Shriners continuously flipped us off, called us names, and insulted us.
