Seven animal rights activists pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges
that they promoted violence and vandalism against a research company
that tests chemicals on thousands of animals at a New Jersey lab each
year.

The 10-minute arraignment drew about 30 protesters to the federal
courthouse in Trenton, and prompted the U.S. Marshal's Office to
heighten security in and around the building. But the demonstration was
peaceful and the court proceeding ended without incident. 

The defendants, members of the group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty,
were indicted last month on charges of conspiring to commit animal
enterprise terrorism, an offense punishable by three years in prison.
Prosecutors contend the defendants encouraged and in some cases planned
attacks to intimidate the research company Huntingdon Life Sciences, its
clients or associates.

Huntingdon uses thousands of animals -- mainly rats, but also dogs and
monkeys -- to conduct product safety tests each year for its clients,
primarily pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers. The company is
based in London, but performs most of the tests at a laboratory in
Franklin Township, Somerset County.
