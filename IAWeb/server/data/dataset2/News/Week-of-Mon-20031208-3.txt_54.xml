Squirrels and chipmunks can be seen or heard looking for food throughout the 
forested areas of SUBASE. Their population is based on the abundance of food 
on the base, according to Andrew Stackpole, the Navy Region Northeast 
environmental program manager. 
Things that crawl, slither, and croak at Naval Submarine Base New London 
(SUBASE)? No, this isn't an advertisement for the latest horror flick at the 
Dealey Center Theater, but rather a survey of the herpetological fauna at SUBASE. 
What the heck is "herpetological fauna," one might ask? It's the reptiles 
(snakes and turtles) and amphibians (frogs and salamanders) that occupy the wilder 
areas of this facility. 
Believe it or not, SUBASE does have its wild areas, and everything from deer, 
otter, Canada geese and coyotes to seals, turkeys, hawks and foxes have been 
spotted on SUBASE. About the only things the environmental department has not 
seen are bear and moose, although those animals have been spotted just miles 
from the base.
Under Navy policy, SUBASE is required to implement an integrated Natural 
Resources Management Plan to ensure the natural resources of the base are managed 
wisely and in compliance with federal and state regulations. SUBASE New London 
teamed with a Natural Resources contractor, Dr. Joe Mitchell, to survey the 
reptiles and amphibians on the base. They have just wrapped up the field work 
for the survey, which involved a lot of night work and wading through the 
wetlands and streams. 
The survey showed that parts of SUBASE support very healthy populations of 
reptiles and amphibians. These creatures, aside from being a part of the local 
ecosystem of ponds and wetlands in the northern portions of the base, provide 
great insect and rodent control services.</content>
