When ordinary citizens are not engaged in civic life, a democratic
society becomes unbalanced. The minority that speaks out is heard; the

spent last summer going door-to-door and staking out supermarkets to
collect more than 6,000 signatures to get the proposal on Denver's Aug.
10 ballot.

"I was like: `I'm so young, could this really make a difference?"' she
says.

Her answer: "If you believe in it you have the power to do it."
