  <content>Art Sosa is taking us on a tour of his farm in Donna.
It?s home to more than 80 heads of cattle and that?s why he moved some of his 
son?s animals over to the Donna  High School Ag farm, where he attends class.
?I did have consent from the Ag school teachers to put them there,? Art 
explains.
He showed us what he calls a written agreement between the teachers and 
himself with signatures included.
But, it?s apparently not enough.
Art recently received district letters shortly after Action 4 News exposed 
potential animal cruelty with a dead, student pig at the ag farm.
They ordered Art to remove his animals from the farm.
?I  would, but I don?t know if the animals have a disease and I don?t want to 
infect the other animals on the farm,? Art says in defense.
A 250 pound swine was found in a bloody pen, allegedly some three days after 
it died last week. 
The school district says it suspended both ag teachers and met behind closed 
doors at an emergency school board meeting to discuss an investigation into 
the death?but that?s not all.
They also met to kick art off the farm.
