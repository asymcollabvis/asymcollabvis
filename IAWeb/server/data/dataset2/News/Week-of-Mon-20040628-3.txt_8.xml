MILTON - Over 30 exotic animals seized from a Milton home in December
were turned over to the town after their owner failed to pay a security
bond for their care, the executive director of an international humane
society for exotic animals said.

The animals were seized from Linda Kastle's home on Dec. 31 after she
had been hospitalized, Marlborough police said at the time. Police said
seven monkeys, eight exotic birds, a prairie dog, 13 cats, four dogs,
four tortoises, a squirrel and a rat were removed from the home.
