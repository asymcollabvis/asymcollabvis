Sightings of big cats on rise in city's parks, greenbelt

It seems unlikely, but an increasing number of mountain lions have 
been spotted along Boise's famous greenbelt and in urban parks during the 
past few months.

On Monday, Gary Mountain was riding his bicycle on a path near the Boise 
River at lunchtime when he spotted a cougar crossing the greenbelt below 
Warm Springs Mesa.

"I thought, `Do I look like a predator to him or do I look like lunch?"' 
Mountain said after the incident.

Idaho Fish and Game officials say mountain lions are more common this year 
in the foothills above Boise because deer numbers have increased.

Mild winters in the past few years have increased deer numbers; and mountain 
lions follow the herds. In all, there have been about a dozen reports in the 
past several months in the Boise area.</content>
