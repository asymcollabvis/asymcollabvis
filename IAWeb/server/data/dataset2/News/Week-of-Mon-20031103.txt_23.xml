Jack Bradley, 6, proudly showed off the pinch marks on his arm he got 
collecting crabs for the classroom tank he and classmates at Midland Elementary 
School were exploring last week. 
The Rye second-grade students were learning about marine life by observing 
and handling specimens they collected at the Edith Read Sanctuary and by reading 
about sea creatures at the school library and on the Internet. When the 
students are finished with their observations, the fish and crabs will be returned 
to the sanctuary. 
"Next summer, when I go to the beach with my dad, I'll know how to look for 
hermit crabs, green crabs and minnows," Jack said.
