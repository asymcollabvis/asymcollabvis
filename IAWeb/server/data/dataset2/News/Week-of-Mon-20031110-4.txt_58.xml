Last week, the Boca Raton Planning &amp; Zoning Board recommended against the
application of Suspended Animation Inc. to build a laboratory.
...
Experiments would be done on about 100 rats a year, the company has said.
This has brought furious opposition from animal-rights supporters --
though I'll bet many other animal lovers would gladly off a few rats if it
meant a chance to bring their Fido back.

In voting 6-0 against Suspended Animation's application, Planning &amp; Zoning
Board members said they weren't swayed by the animal-rights crowd or by
suspicions that cryonics is more Woody Allen's Sleeper than an actual
science. They said the business just didn't fit city plans.
