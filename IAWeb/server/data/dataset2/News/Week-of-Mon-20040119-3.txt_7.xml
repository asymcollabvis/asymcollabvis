The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals won a battle against the 
owners of a Ben Wheeler puppy mill Wednesday when a Van Zandt County judge 
ruled they were guilty of animal cruelty and must relinquish the dogs to the 
animal rights group. 
Precinct 4 Justice of the Peace Tracey Garner, who presided over the hearing 
to determine custody of the dogs, ruled the mill operators will have to give 
the remaining 30 to 40 canines on their property to the SPCA, which seized 110 
of them Jan 16. 
All the dogs will remain with the SPCA in Dallas and McKinney until they are 
put up for adoption. 
The judge also ordered mill operators to pay the SPCA $6,480 as reimbursement 
for the money it has cost the organization to provide proper care for the 
dogs - $10 a day for each animal for six days.</content>
