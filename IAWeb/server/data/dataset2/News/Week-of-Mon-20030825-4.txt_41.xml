Rep. Dennis Kucinich may be a vegetarian, but he is
throwing his crowds plenty of red meat in his campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination.

"This administration with its go-it-alone approach has heightened
tensions in the world and created a situation where America is less
safe, not more safe," Kucinich said last week while campaigning in
Pennsylvania. "Corporate control of government is going up; the hand
of corporations is reaching into our electoral process, able to
assure the election of candidates who have nothing in common with the
American people."

Kucinich's hard-edged populism is appealing to liberal voters and
labor union members, many of whom seem receptive to angry messages.

Congressional crusader

"I met a woman and fell in love" is how the divorced Kucinich begins
when asked how he became a vegetarian, a rarity in the carnivorous
world of presidential politics. His friend persuaded him to change
his eating habits, and he became a vegan - one who uses no animal
products whatsoever, including milk and eggs.

He eats organically grown food almost exclusively. He is so committed
that he soaks newly hulled oats overnight so they'll be tender for
breakfast oatmeal.

Kucinich's attentiveness to food extends to food policy. In Congress,
he is the leading proponent of toughening federal regulation of
genetically modified food and labeling the packaging of products with
engineered ingredients.

He attributes his little success so far on the issue to a public
relations and lobbying effort by Monsanto Co. and others in the
biotechnology industry allied with farm organizations and
pharmaceutical companies. </content>
