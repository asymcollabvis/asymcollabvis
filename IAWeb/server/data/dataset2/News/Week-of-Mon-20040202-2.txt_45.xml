Last week, a very sad but little known event took place in Orange. 

Orange lost its oldest bovine resident that I know of, or for that matter 
have ever treated. 



I returned from a conference in sunny Florida to a message from one of my 
cherished clients telling me that his 30-year-old cow Valentine (yes, I DID say 
30) was unable to get up. My heart sank. 

Two years ago, I received a similar call but we were able to get her up and 
get her on some aspirin boluses (giant cow pills) to help her with her 
arthritis. You could literally hear Valentine walk across the pasture as she creaked 
with arthritis and squeak as she chewed her cud with very worn teeth after so 
many years of use. We knew that for two years, she had been on borrowed time 
and now that time had probably come.

Big deal, you might say, if you are not an animal person. Thirty years and a 
cow at that. Let me tell you that Valentine's owners took care of her and 
loved her every bit as much as many of my clients love their dog, cat, goat, 
sheep, rabbit or what have you. 

I have looked into the welled up eyes of a little boy handing me his pet rat 
dying of congestive heart failure and a woman with her mixed breed dog 
(although we ALL thought Maude was truly a person in a little, feisty fur suit...) 
rescued from a shelter as an already very senior pet and now suffering from 
heart disease and cancer, and that man with his cow who had finally given up at 
the age of 30 and heard the same question " Is it time now?" with the same pain 
in their voices and hearts. Such a hard question to ask and answer, even 
having been on both sides of the fence.</content>
