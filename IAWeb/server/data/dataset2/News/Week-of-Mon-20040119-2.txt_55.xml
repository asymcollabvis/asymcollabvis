Dahlia: Mutts walk the walk 
January 21, 2004 
Plenty of pretty kitties were on hand, but not a catfight was to be found 
during the third annual Mutts and Models fashion extravaganza, held recently at 
the Gothic Theatre.
It's the only fashion show in town where Denver's most fashionable folks 
mingle with the bow-wows - literally - bringing their favorite four-legged friends 
to the benefit for Harrison Memorial Animal Hospital.

   


For this year's fete, aptly titled "Pets in the City," the mutts and the 
models strutted their stuff in front of a New York City skyline backdrop provided 
by Dave Barnes of ScenoGraphics, in fabulous fashions by New York designer 
David Rodriguez, who flew to Denver for the fete.
Rodriguez's clothes have graced countless celebrities, most notably the 
pretty kitties on the hit HBO series Sex and the City.</content>
