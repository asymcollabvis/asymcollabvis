Jesus Banderas gets the dog?s attention while Lutz then attacks on owner Tina 
Armer?s command.
He calls it a hobby.

But the time, energy and love that Hollister resident Jesus Banderas puts 
into training his German Shepherd in the sport of Schutzhund resembles something 
more along the lines of a passion.

Schutzhund stems from a German word meaning ?protection dog.? 

It began in the early 1900s in Germany as a way to train dogs in tracking, 
obedience and protection - specifically to maintain the working ability of the 
dogs.

It has been a popular sport in Europe for years, and has recently been 
catching on in the states, with Schutzhund clubs and competitions all over the 
country. Banderas is a devout member of the Monterey Bay Schutzhund Club.

For Banderas, it was his love of German Shepherds that lured him into the 
sport about eight years ago, and has held him in its clutches ever since.

?I guess you?ve got to like dogs, and I always have - as long as I can 
remember,? he said. 

In 1994 Banderas moved to Hollister and commuted to his job in Watsonville, 
where he would pass by a house where he always saw German Shepherds outside.

After about a year of continually telling himself one day he would stop and 
inquire about a puppy, he finally did.</content>
