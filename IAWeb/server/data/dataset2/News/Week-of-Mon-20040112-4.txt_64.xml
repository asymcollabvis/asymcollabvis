  <content>Pike County Sheriff Larry Travis doesn't expect to file charges 
against the owner of 52 horses he seized late last week after complaints of 
neglect. 
Travis seized the animals and the Long Fork Road barn in which they are 
housed Friday with the cooperation of the owner, Columbus resident Ivan Orozco, who 
declined to comment for this report. 
In mid-December, area animal rights workers brought the horses to Travis' 
attention, who said he checked up on the animals about every other day. 
Veterinarian Kristen Rohde, founder of the group Ohio Horse Rescue, told 
county commissioners Jan. 5 she had found the horses to be severely underfed, with 
only a 1 1/2 bales of hay for the entire herd to share, with one dead in its 
stall and another following closely behind. She took the most severely ill 
horse to care for it herself with the owner's consent in mid-December and could 
not be reached for further comment or the condition of the horse. 
"The original complaint, it was my understanding, that 50 of these horses are 
starving, and that's just not the case," said County Prosecutor Rob Junk. He 
said it seems there was no intent to cause harm to the animals, but that it 
was a matter of inexperience with caring for horses. 
"Looking at that, there wasn't any intent for anybody to hurt or starve any 
animal or anything like that, but especially based on these people's 
cooperation on this, we aren't looking at any charges now," he said. </content>
