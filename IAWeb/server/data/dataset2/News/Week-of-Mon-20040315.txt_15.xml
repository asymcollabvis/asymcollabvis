Crocodiles killed 18 people in the area last 
year, it is said. 

Aketch has heard it all before. 

He was once called in to hunt a croc that had 
eaten a young boy. He shot a large one and when 
it was cut open, the child's head was found inside. 

Aketch Aduor, like many hunters, considers himself a 
conservationist. In his long career he has not shot 
during the nesting season and only takes animals that 
are over five feet long. 

"You can't kill off your source," he says. 

Now a successful Blantyre businessman with interests 
in construction, Aketch says he can get about $200 
a skin although he no longer needs the money. 

He now has a permit for only 25 crocodiles a year. 
Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES), Malawi's annual export quota of the 
reptile's skins is capped at 200. 

"They are not letting us remove enough of the animals," 
Aketch said -- adding that poor villagers are suffering 
the consequences.
