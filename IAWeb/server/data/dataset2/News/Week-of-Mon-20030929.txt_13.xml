  West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne illness that 
has killed almost 100 Americans this year, has just a toehold in California 
-- it is lurking here, in the dried-out desert marshes at the edge of the 
Salton Sea.

Soon, that may change for the worse.

Over the objections of local mosquito control experts, hundreds of acres 
owned by private duck clubs are being flooded, with water pumped from wells, 
to accommodate bird life for the hunting season.

Predictably, the sparse mosquito population has begun to grow.

Pesticide spraying and other mosquito abatement techniques may keep the 
disease in check, but Riverside County scientists are concerned. The duck 
ponds are known for breeding large swarms of Culex tarsalis, the mosquito 
species that lab studies show is best suited for transmitting West Nile.

"We are going to see an increase in the number of mosquitoes we catch in 
traps," said Branka Lothrop, an ecologist for the Coachella Valley Mosquito 
and Vector Control District in Riverside County. "Instead of five or 10 per 
trap each night, there will be hundreds or even thousands."

Lothrop is concerned that the flooding of the desert marshes will create 
ideal conditions to boost the virus. "All those hunters are 65 to 70 years 
old,

and they get covered with mosquitoes," she said. "And building up the 
mosquito population in the fall cannot be good for the spring."
