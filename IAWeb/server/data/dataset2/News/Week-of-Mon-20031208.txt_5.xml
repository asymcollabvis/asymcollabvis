  <content>But this animal -- traditionally used by washer-men to carry bundles of 
clothes -- is fast disappearing in Jharkhand if a new animal census is to be 
believed.

The ass population in three Jharkhand districts -- Hazaribagh, Chatra and 
Koderma -- was over 100 in the last animal census that took place 20 years ago. 
But now just a dozen of them remain. 

The last census was conducted there in 1981 when Jharkhand was part of Bihar. 

The decline may have something to do with lesser interest in the animal.

"Even in rural areas of the state, few washer-men use donkeys today. Nobody 
has been bothered about breeding the animal any more. As a result, their 
numbers have declined," said an official of the animal husbandry department. 

Alarm bells are also ringing for elephants, tigers, deer and other wildlife 
in the state. 

According to animal census report, the population of elephants has come down 
from 752 to 400. The tiger population has declined to 42 from 142 and the 
cheetal deer population from 20,186 to 16,384. 

The monkey population has, however, gone up -- from 40,795 in the last 
census, it is now 64,485. The bear population too has increased from 1,102 to 1,808. 

Forest officials say tribals often kill animals as part of their traditional 
rituals.</content>
