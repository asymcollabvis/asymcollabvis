At the risk of sounding like a liberal, I am going to present this argument. 
As you read it, I hope that you will understand as I do...it is not a liberal 
nor a conservative issue, rather one of common sense and decency. Just in case 
you are wondering...I detest PETA and I eat meat (just like my dogs!).

The cruel practice of testing new pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products on 
animals must stop and I believe I have a viable replacement. There is not one 
person of conscience who could visit an animal testing facility without deciding 
that it is wrong. At the same time, there is not one reasonable person who 
could visit a maximum security prison and agree that rapists, murderers, drug 
dealers, and child molesters deserve a comfortable life, or that they should 
simply be warehoused until they die, or released to bring about more harm. 

Regardless of the immorality of testing on innocent animals, it makes no 
sense to test a new drug or procedure on them. Who better to test a drug produced 
for humans than another human? Rapists and murderers have given up their 
rights, these are people that have brought about terrible suffering throughout 
their lives. Shouldn?t they be given the chance to contribute something, for once 
in their lives? </content>
