A Dec. 9 story in the Main News section about a Web log written by 
animal-rights activist Virgil Butler contained several errors. The article, from the Los 
Angeles Times, said Butler took part in the U.S. invasion of Panama, where he 
recalled killing enemy soldiers, but the Army has no record of his service. 
The article stated that Butler shot a man to death in the parking lot of a bar 
and went to prison for manslaughter. In fact, he was convicted of felony 
burglary, and the shooting could not be confirmed. The article said Butler killed 
80,000 birds a shift at a Tyson poultry plant. He did not slaughter every 
chicken personally but was part of a nine-person team.
In his blog, Butler also claims he saw his co-workers at a Tyson plant in 
Grannis rip the heads off live chickens, stomp them to death and blow them up 
with dry-ice bombs.

Polk County Sheriff Michael Oglesby investigated the allegations but found no 
proof. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also looked into the claims but 
"could not substantiate them," spokesman Steven Cohen said.
