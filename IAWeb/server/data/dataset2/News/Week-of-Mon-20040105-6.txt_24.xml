A family watched in horror as fox hounds savaged their pet cat in their 
garden, it emerged today.

Jennifer Kervell and her daughters, seven and three, were in the kitchen 
preparing lunch when around 30 hounds from the West Somerset Vale Hunt came into 
the garden and tore apart their four-year-old cat called Holly.

Mrs Kervell, 30, from Combwich, near Bridgwater in Somerset, said her 
daughters screamed as they watched Holly being ?savaged?.

She said: ?One minute we were admiring the beautiful hounds then we suddenly 
realised they were sniffing around our garden for something.

?The hounds went out of view for a moment, then I realised they had hold of 
something. I could see it was Holly. I told the girls to go into the dining 
room but they wouldn?t listen. They saw everything and were screaming and 
screaming.?

Mrs Kervell, who describes herself as an animal lover and has two dogs of her 
own, said the hounds were still ?sniffing around? when she went outside to 
retrieve the remains of her pet.

?I went outside with a towel to get the body, which had been savaged, and the 
dogs were still there. The hunt master had obviously lost control of them. I 
had to gently push them away,? she said.

The incident, which happened on Christmas Eve, ?ruined? the family?s 
Christmas, Mrs Kervell said.

She added that she had always thought fox hunting was ?barbaric?, but had 
never thought it would affect her or her family.

?I live in the countryside and accept that hunting goes on but I would rather 
not think about it,? she said.

?I never thought they would come into my garden and affect my family. We are 
all devastated.?</content>
