Up to 12 pairs of eyes have peered back at Chris Pilkington when he has looked out his window at night. And those dozen coyotes are making him jittery. 

He thinks coyotes are responsible for the death of seven of his goats over the last six months, including his beloved Rosebud - his pet of 12 years.
He's afraid for his 75-year-old mother, who likes to spend her days outdoors gardening. He's afraid for his Dalmatian and his black cat. And, recently, he has started fearing for his own safety. 

The coyotes, once afraid to come out in the daytime, now casually stroll across the field in front of his 5-acre parcel at all times of the day. They don't flinch when he comes outside. He has to make a racket to scare them off. He said it's unsettling.
