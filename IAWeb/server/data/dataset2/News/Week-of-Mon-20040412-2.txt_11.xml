Chimps fashion stalks and twigs to get inside termite mounds
It would seem young female chimpanzees take their studies a little more 
seriously than their male classmates, a study in the journal Nature has shown. 
Females learn from their mothers how to gather termites much faster than 
males - who prefer to spend more of their time playing, US scientists say. 
Elizabeth Lonsdorf and colleagues conducted their research on wild chimps in 
Tanzania's Gombe National Park. 
They say the gender differences are similar to those seen in young humans. 
Girls and boys pick up fine motor skills such as writing at different rates, 
and the team suggests its research could therefore indicate that sex-based 
learning differences may have an ancient origin. 
Educationalists trying to develop learning strategies for children could find 
the work instructive, the scientists believe. 
"This finding is a heads-up to researchers studying the learning of 
relatively complex skills that they should take sex into account," said Dr Lonsdorf, 
the director of field conservation at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.</content>
