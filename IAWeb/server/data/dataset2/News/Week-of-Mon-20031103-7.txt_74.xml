  <content>No matter what diet you are on, if you eat
less and lose weight you also lower your risk of heart disease, doctors
told a conference on Sunday.
...
"The type of person who is going to go for a low-fat, vegetarian diet is
not, in my experience, the kind of person who is going to go for a
high-meat diet," Dansinger said.

But for people with high cholesterol levels, the Ornish diet might be the
most beneficial, Dansinger said.

"The Ornish diet, low-fat vegetarian, was best for lowering the bad LDL
cholesterol, while other diets were better at raising the good HDL
cholesterol," Dansinger said. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol is the
stuff that clogs arteries, while high density lipoprotein carries fat out
of the blood.

The Ornish diet cut LDL by 10 percent and Atkins lowered it 2 percent to 3
percent, Dansinger said.

Ornish said doctors often place too high a value on high HDL levels. "If
you reduce fat, there is less garbage, less saturated fat and cholesterol,
so your body needs less garbage trucks," he said.

But Dansinger said his study was one of several that has suggested the
high-fat Atkins diet, in the short-term, does not raise the risk of heart
disease.
