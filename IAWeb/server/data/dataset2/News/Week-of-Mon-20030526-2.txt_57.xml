Luella Vedric, New York socialite and animal advocate answers questions
...
When did you give up wearing fur?
-- Terry Mulley, Columbus

When I realized how wicked a practice it was! And when I realized one
could look gorgeous while not wearing fur, of course! You know I am now
a major contributor to SPOMA [Society for the Prevention of Mistreatment 
of Animals]. Collie's [SPOMA director Catherine Carnes] one of my dearest
friends. 

Do you support other animal rights groups like PETA? What do you think about
more forceful advocates like ELF, AJL, and SPEAC?
-- Don Rabinowitz, New York

I think I need some alphabet soup to figure them all out! But really dears, I
support SPOMA, but I don't like violent groups. I'm against violence toward
any animal and people are just another kind of animal.
...
Do you have any pets, besides Lily, that is?
-- Donna Ghostley, Richmond

I have an enormous tropical fish habitat at home. I love tropical fish!
And they are very well cared for. Mr. Kim, my supplier, is always checking
up on how they are doing. I have the most wonderful Zebra fish and rays and
arowanas.
