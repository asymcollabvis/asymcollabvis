LANESBORO -- The Cole Bros. Circus is coming to the Berkshire Mall this
weekend, and with it could come animal rights protesters angry about the
troupe's use of animals in its shows.

Earlier this week, during a WNAW radio interview with a Lions Club
member, a caller announced she would be protesting the circus. She said
that the use of animals in the show was cruel and unnecessary.

The circus is sponsored by the Dalton Lions Club.

Protesters gathered at a Cole Bros. show last weekend at Thomas J. Dodd
Stadium in Norwich, Conn. "Stop animal abuse," read one sign carried by
demonstrators.

Any circus protesters that show up at this weekend's three-ring show
would not be a surprise to Cole Bros. marketing director Mario Vitali.
