SEOUL - "Have you ever seen the origins of life?" asks Hwang Woo Suk,
leader of a South Korean team of scientists credited with creating the
world's first cloned human embryos. He slaps on a pair of surgical gloves
with a whack. "They don't always smell very good," he chuckles.

Hwang should know. After voluntarily suspending the South Korean human
embryo project as he waits for international and domestic consensus on the
ethics of his work, Hwang still has his hands full, going back to his
roots -- in a pig sty.

He whirls around to where assistants have a 6-foot-long sow, an anesthesia
mask strapped over her snout, splayed out rather indelicately on her back,
feet in the air, resting on a steel gurney in a pig pen steaming with
methane. Ignoring the indignant grunts resonating from the lineup of other
surrogate mothers still on all fours, he cuts open the belly of the pig,
punching his gloved hand deep inside her until he pulls out her uterus. 
...
His shoe-string cloning project operates on a fraction of the budget
typical in Western labs. "Their organs will be more suitable for human
transplants."

"Cloning," he says, tucking the uterus back in, "should be used to improve
the human condition."

"Ok, so I cloned a human embryo," he says, moving away from the pig. "Do
you blame me? Who can blame me? I am not out to clone a human. I am trying
to save human lives. If I were out for more," he said, gesturing with a
bloody glove around the pungent sty, "do you think I'd be working in a
place like this?" </content>
