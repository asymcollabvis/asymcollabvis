OREGON CITY -- Sarah Christopherson charted the course that led to the
high school diploma she will receive this summer.
...
Fifteen months ago, Christopherson became a vegetarian then a vegan, who
eats no meat, eggs, cheese or any food that comes from animals.

For her, it was an act of conscience. She was repelled by factory
farming where animals may be caged all their lives.

"I just didn't like the process that (animals) went through,"
Christopherson said.

"I thought it was just a phase, but for her, she was choosing it as a
way of life," Eunice Christopherson said.
