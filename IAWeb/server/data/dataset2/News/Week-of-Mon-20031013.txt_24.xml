The San Francisco Bay is getting an ecological report card today -- and it 
doesn't look good. But there's hope behind the C's, D's and an F, according to 
the nonprofit environmental group that graded the bay's health. 
New laws and regulations that cut down on water pollution and a Bay Area 
campaign to restore wetlands are just beginning to stabilize 150 years of decline 
in the bay's once-abundant native fish and wildlife populations, according to 
the Bay Institute of San Francisco. 
"The destruction of San Francisco Bay's unique environment has in some cases 
been halted or even slightly reversed," said Grant Davis, Bay Institute 
executive director. 
To measure the health of the bay, scientists with the Bay Institute in Novato 
spent three years examining such things as wildlife habitat and pollutants, 
and prepared the Bay Index 2003. Scientists also looked at freshwater flows 
from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and the numbers of fish, shellfish and 
the microscopic plankton that feed these higher forms of aquatic life. 
The bay's grades -- one B, three C's, three D's and an F -- were based on 
historical conditions, environmental and public health standards, and restoration 
targets, according to the institute.
