 Criminal trespassing charges have been filed against a federal 
wolf recovery official and another man who were found with four wolves on a 
private ranch.

The men may have inadvertently landed their helicopter on private land Feb. 
14 to place radio tracking collars on four wolves that had been tranquilized, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials have said.

Park County Attorney Bryan Skoric said biologist Michael Jimenez of the Fish 
and Wildlife Service and Wesley Livingston of Hawkins and Powers Aviation, 
each faced two counts: trespassing and placing or depositing objects upon the 
property of another, "more commonly known as littering," according to a statement 
released through his office.

Both are misdemeanor counts that carry maximum penalties of up to $750 in 
fines and up to six months in jail, he said.
The statement did not specify what items were considered to be litter.

Jimenez, wolf recovery project leader for Wyoming, did not immediately return 
a telephone call seeking comment Friday.
