Robert Wright had planned
what he would do
if the
Grand Prix
Fire came
near his
creekside
house.
The veteran dog rescuer had already secured a           promise of temporary shelter for himself and
his 12  dogs at a
Korean  mission just down  the road.
                       
But at 10 a.m. on Oct. 25, with an out-of-control backfire twisting in  the hills above his house, the flames were moving  too fast. As Wright scrambled to organize the dogs
for a backwoods dash to the mission, Kern County
firefighters rushed into the neighborhood and told
him to get out.

                       "I told the fire gentlemen I'm not going nowhere without those dogs," Wright said. "They loaded the whole crew into a fire truck."
                       Sheltered from flames inside a circle of cleared ground at the mission, Wright, his dogs and five cats weathered the fire. One of his dogs crawled under a
utility truck and gave birth to a litter of six puppies. 

By 11 a.m., Wright's home had burned to the
ground. He and his dogs have lived at the Lytle
Creek Calvary Pentecostal Church since the fire.
Wright, 58, has lived 14 years in Lytle Creek and
has rescued dogs other people dump in a mountain
canyon since the early 1990s. He began helping
former Lytle Creek resident Roseanne Abrams with
her animal rescue in 1995. When Abrams moved to
Idaho in 1997, Wright took over the rescue alone.

"He would die for those animals. He's a very simple
man, a man of simple means, but he's got the heart,"
Abrams said.
