Chinchillas are rodents which once roamed the Andes of 
South America in large numbers. C. brevicaudata, short 
tailed chinchilla was hunted to deplation and is endangered. 
Its native range included the Peruvian Andes, Bolivia, 
Chile and Argentina. The long tailed species, C. lanigera, 
has been listed as endangered and was thought to be 
extinct. Chinchilla are endangered because of hunting 
and trapping of the animals for its pelts and recent 
upsurge in poaching for pets. Between 1895 and 1921 over 
three million chinchilla pelts including a small number of 
live animals were exported from Chile. Some authors 
report that more then 21 million chinchillas were actually 
killed between 1840 and 1916 and only a fraction of 
those caught were able to be exported. Upon rediscovery 
of wild C. lanigera in central Chile during the mid-1970's 
a series of studies on these endangered rodent 
populations have tried to understand chinchillas, their 
habitat and populations which continue to decline. Pet 
fanciers have driven up the market for wild chinchilla as
their colors and fur quality are different and unobtainable
in domestically farmed breeds. Smuggling operations out of 
Chile and Peru are said to be well-financed and efficiently
run.
