Through the Energy for Wildlife program, the NWTF staff will work directly 
with AGL Resources to integrate wildlife management activities, especially for 
wild turkey habitat, into the company's land oversight programs. Through its 
subsidiary, Atlanta Gas Light Company, AGL Resources has approximately 1,500 
miles of natural gas pipeline in Georgia. 
"This partnership with the NTWF is part of our mandate to be a good steward 
of the environment," said Lindsay Thomas, senior vice president of governmental 
affairs and an avid outdoorsman. "This allows us to encourage the growth of a 
fascinating native American bird, the wild turkey. And by encouraging turkey 
habitat, we will be providing habitat and food source for species of both game 
and non-game wildlife such as our native song birds." 
In the early 1930s, wild turkeys were on the verge of extinction, but thanks 
to wildlife agencies and conservation programs such as the NWTF's Energy for 
Wildlife, the birds have made a dramatic comeback. The NWTF estimates that the 
population has grown from only about 30,000 turkeys 70 years ago to more than 
6 million today. 
According to the NWTF, a varied habitat of both open and covered area is ess
ential for wild turkey survival. Wild turkeys prefer open areas for feeding and 
mating, a requirement met by land along pipelines and power lines. The wily 
birds use forested areas nearby as cover from predators and as roosts at night. </content>
