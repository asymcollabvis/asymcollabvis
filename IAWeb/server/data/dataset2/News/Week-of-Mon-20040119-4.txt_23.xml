Acts of terrorism can do more than just physical damage, and that concerns 
the agriculture industry, according to speakers at the Texas High Plains Grain 
Elevator workshop. 
The workshop, Thursday at the Amarillo Civic Center, featured Tim Reid with 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Amarillo. 
Reid said that since Sept. 11, 2001, many aspects of agriculture are looked 
at for security reasons, including crop-dusting planes, feedlot security and 
the transportation industry. 
It would take an immense amount of chemicals, more than most anyone could get 
their hands on at one time, to contaminate many crops or even the water 
system, he said. 
But Amarillo is no stranger to potential terrorists. Reid said an individual 
from Jordan was living in Amarillo prior to Sept. 11, and was reported as 
inquiring about crop dusters after Sept. 11. He was a medical doctor, had not been 
working for three years, but received substantial amounts of money in his 
bank account. 
The individual denied the crop-dusting conversations ever took place, but 
during the 12-hour questioning, he was deceptive in his answers, Reid said. 
Some cells may not be asked to do a terrorist act, but they may be asked to 
get information. For example, one individual in Amarillo was tasked only to 
take pictures of Pantex, Reid said. 
Reid said people may get complacent with the color alert going up around 
holidays and big events, but it's important to be ready for whatever may happen. 
"We better hope we don't get into the norm and people ignore the alerts," 
Reid said. 
Reid said the FBI deals with international terrorists but also domestic 
terrorists when it comes to the agriculture industry. 
"Those people are living here. They may be working for you," he said.</content>
