While game-viewing in Africa is normally the preserve of affluent white 
tourists, the Mokolodi Nature Reserve does something radically different by 
exposing black Africans to the continent's rich animal and plant kingdom.
The formula has been so successful that 12,000 children who would otherwise 
have no contact with wild Africa now attend a range of free educational and 
residential courses each year at the reserve in Botswana.
They can walk with Mokolodi's four-strong herd of elephants, stroke two 
orphaned cheetahs until they purr, go on bush walks and have a range of wildlife 
experiences that would normally cost foreign tourists thousands of pounds.
This Christmas Mokolodi will partly ease Botswana's huge HIV/Aids burden by 
offering a bush camp to 300 children either infected with the virus or orphaned 
by the pandemic.
"It all started when a friend of mine said how sad it was for children in 
Africa to grow up without really knowing their environment," said Gwithie Kirby, 
one of Mokolodi's founders.</content>
