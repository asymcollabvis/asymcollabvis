  <content>Dressed in prisoner suits and dog and cat masks, activists in three 
Dutch cities will cram themselves into cages to illustrate the misery of 
animals neglected and killed in crude ?nutrition? tests conducted by the Procter 
&amp; Gamble (P&amp;G)-owned pet-food company Iams, which also manufacture Eukanuba. 
Concerned PETA Europe members and dog- and cat-food purchasers will also hold 
signs reading, ?Stop Iams Cruelty?. The protests will mark the official Dutch 
launch of PETA?s international campaign against Iams ? similar actions are 
taking place throughout Europe and North America.</content>
