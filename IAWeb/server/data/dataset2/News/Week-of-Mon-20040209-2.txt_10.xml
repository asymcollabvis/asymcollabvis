Okay, first things first: The animal-rights people claim veal calves are
treated cruelly. So I looked it up, point for point. Here are the main points:

The PETA-types complain that the animals are kept in confining pens that
don't allow the animals to move or even to lie down (much like my cubicle
at work). The veal farmers counter that the pens come only up to shoulder
height, thus allowing the animals to socialize; the pens are large enough
to allow the calves to lie down, stand up, and groom themselves; and
having pens allows careful individual monitoring for health and helps
prevent the spread of disease.

Now, check your Bible for "swaddling clothes," then ask an anthropologist
about it.

Veal generally will be more tender and mild-flavored than the average cut
of beef. Hence, like tofu, it is immensely versatile. If you can find a
whole veal tenderloin, and you feel like making a real celebration of a
given meal (i.e., this isn't something you're going to do every day and
you want beaucoup leftovers), you can dice the tenderloin and make chili.
Perhaps veal stew. If you want to make a crust from scratch: veal pot pie.
Yankee veal roast. Old-fashioned Southern pulled barbecued veal.
...
Get yourself some baby cow today. It's perfectly humane; it's moderately
affordable; it's nutritious and delicious; and it's so tender and
versatile you can't mess it up. Did I mention piling it on top of an
English muffin with a fried egg and some smoked Gouda and bacon?
