Nancy Fisk's first love was horses. She grew up with them, 
taught horseback riding and studied horsemanship in England. 

     It was her love of horses that led Fisk, 57, to her true passion: 
raising Akita dogs. 

     It started in 1982 when Fisk was teaching horseback riding at the Dana 
Hall School in Wellesley. As she explains, a young man needed a place to stay 
and moved in -- along with three dogs, two horses, a few cats and parrots. 

     Two of the dogs were Akitas, and in October that year the female gave 
birth to a litter. 

     "I just fell in love with her," Fisk said of one puppy, whom she named 
Akiko. "I decided I wanted to breed her." 

     Twenty years later, Fisk owns Akiko Akitas on Maple Street, home to 25 
purebreed Akitas spanning four generations and the birth place of dozens more. 

     Some have competed in the renowned Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, 
which wrapped up its 128th event earlier this month. Others have been sold to 
owners from Europe to Hawaii, with the price tag ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. 

     But to think Fisk breeds Akitas for the money is a huge mistake. </content>
