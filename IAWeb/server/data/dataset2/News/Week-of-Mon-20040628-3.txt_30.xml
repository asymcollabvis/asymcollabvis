The history of the Russian Animal Liberation Front

First actions of the Russian Animal Liberation Front (RALF) took place
in the south of the country in 2000. In Krasnodar region and Republic of
Adigeya, organizations responsible for exploitation and killing of
animals began to be regularly attacked. The walls of the administrative
building of the Sochi meat producing plant were decorated with slogans
of protest several times. "Corpse carrier" and other signs were written
on the vehicles of this plant. Sochi meat plant is the largest supplier
of products of animal killing in the south of Russia. In July 2001,
protest slogans with abbreviation "A.L.F." appeared on the walls of the
company representing Sochi meat plant in the port of Novorossiysk. Also
in Novorossiysk, a bucket of black paint was dumped on the stand
advertising products of the local meat plant. 
...
From Oct 2003 until May 2004, RALF SG circulated 25 issues of updates.
In addition to information about A.L.F. there are periodic materials on
Earth liberation and actions towards it.

... and it is just a beginning!
