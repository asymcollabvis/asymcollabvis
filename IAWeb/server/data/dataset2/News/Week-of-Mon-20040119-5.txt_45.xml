Despite stringent laws to protect the population of Tigers, an endangered 
species nearing extinction, not a single poacher has been convicted mainly 
because of ignorance and lackadaisical attitude of government officials, an expert 
says.

"The number of the tigers in the country has fallen to 3,500 from about 4,300 
just about a decade ago, but so far not a single conviction has taken place," 
Anjana Gosain, a wildlife lawyer and honorary secretary of an NGO - Tiger 
Trust, says.

Population growth and poaching has resulted in the extinction of three tiger 
species from the country which was a natural habitat for eight species, she 
says adding "since the forest officials are not aware of the animal protection 
rules they do not draft the complaint accordingly and as a result the accused 
goes scot free." The law to prevent the killing of endangered species was 
enacted way back in 1972, but till date there has been no conviction mainly due to 
lack of knowledge among the officials in framing the charges against poachers, 
she says.

"There was a need for serious efforts considering the falling number of 
tigers in the country," she says, adding "people need to understand that the 
animals too have a right to live on the planet and urgent steps should be taken 
before it is too late. 

Government officials, however, blame the slow judicial process for no 
conviction so far.</content>
