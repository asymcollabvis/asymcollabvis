In 1979, Howard Lyman underwent surgery to remove a tumor from his spine
and came out a changed man.

Convinced the growth was caused by the tons of industrial chemicals he
had used on his vast cattle ranch, the self-described ''Donald Trump of
agriculture'' became a food safety and animal rights activist.

Lyman, author of ''Mad Cowboy: Plain Truth From The Cattle Rancher Who
Won't Eat Meat,'' will take his cause to Rhinebeck Saturday, following a
screening of Jenny Stein's ''Peaceable Kingdom'' at Upstate Films. The
2004 documentary, which features Lyman, is about the interconnected
lives of farmers, farm animals and animal rescuers, and is set against
the backdrop of agribusiness.

''It's not about becoming a vegetarian -- it's about becoming
conscious,'' said Kathy Stevens, director of the Catskill Animal
Sanctuary, a 75-acre home for abused and neglected horses and farm
animals in Saugerties, which is sponsoring the screening and talk.
''It's encouraging people to hear about the industry that produces what
we eat and the impact it has on all of us.''
