The good news is that cats are living longer and longer. Ten years ago a cat 
would have been considered geriatric at 10-12 years old. Nowadays, veterinary 
surgeons commonly treat cats of 16 years and even up to 22-23 years. 

Vaccination: The main diseases we vaccinate cats against are Cat flu, Feline 
Enteritis and Feline Leukaemia. As your cat reaches old age it may no longer 
be at risk of getting Feline Enteritis and Feline Leukaemia, but I would 
strongly recommend annual vaccination against Cat flu. Cat flu is very much a 
disease of the young and ageing cat. Like elderly people if an old cat gets a dose 
of flu it can become extremely debilitated and require intensive nursing and 
sometimes intravenous fluids.

Fleas: Old age does not stop the fleas so carry on with regular flea control. 
Most modern flea products act against insects only and are relatively safe 
for the elderly cat. Discuss the safest form of flea control with your vet.
