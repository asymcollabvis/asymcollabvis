Terror comes in many forms. It can be a plane into an
office building or a bomb on a boat driven into an aircraft carrier. Now,
right here in Southern California, a new kind of terrorism has surfaced.
It is just as violent, and just as deadly and is for the most unlikely of
reasons: to protect the environment.

The ELF, or Earth Liberation Front, has been blamed for causing
devastation and terror.
...
"The Earth Liberation Front believes that there has been enough time for
talk, now is the time for action," said Rod Coronado, unofficial ELF
spokesman.
...
But as TEAM 4 Reports has uncovered, that line may be blurring. While many
are familiar with PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, as a
popular cause among animal loving celebrities, it has a financial
connection to Rod Coronado.

"Previous to my going to prison, PETA provided legal defense. They paid
for my lawyers," said Coronado.

"While they've done some laudable work with regard to animal rights,
they've been increasingly linked to Mr. Coronado," said Levin.
...
"We don't support ELF. We support anybody and everybody who speaks out on
behalf of animals in a legal and constitutional way," said Jeff Kerr,
general counsel for PETA.

"Torching a $50 million apartment complex is the only way that we're going
to get the industry to be accountable for the destruction that they are
responsible for," said Coronado.
