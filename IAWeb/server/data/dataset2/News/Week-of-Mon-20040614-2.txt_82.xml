Police in Portland and nine other cities across the country received an
FBI bulletin earlier this month warning that radical environmentalists
planned to protest on June 12, and that "eco-terrorism" could not be
ruled out.

Portland police responded by stepping up patrols where "eco-terrorists"
might hit and by placing the building the FBI warned them about under
surveillance.

The targets of the bulletin and the surveillance, however, turned out to
be events publicized on the Internet to gather support for an Oregon
activist jailed for arson. Portland police kept an eye on the Peoples
Free Space on Congress Street, where about 25 people watched a video
about the activist, Jeff "Free" Luers.

There was no terrorism - eco or otherwise - in any of the cities. But
supporters of the activist are raising questions about whether it was
appropriate for the FBI to issue the warning in the first place. They
say that the bureau overstepped its bounds by linking peaceful,
well-publicized events with terrorism, and that the surveillance was
designed by the FBI to chill political speech.
...
Supporters of Luers, though, say the law enforcement response was both a
waste of time and an inappropriate infringement on their First Amendment
rights.

They note that while members of the ELF generally admit their
affiliation with the loosely knit organization once they have been
arrested, Luers has consistently denied being part of it. Even Ron
Arnold, the author of "Eco Terror: The Violent Agenda to Save Nature"
and one of the ELF's most vocal critics, says he doubts Luers is a
member of the group - and said the prison sentence is so harsh that it
"cheapens the justice system."
