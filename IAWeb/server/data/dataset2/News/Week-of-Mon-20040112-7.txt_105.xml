They should have called her Angel, but instead she was given a name more 
reflective of her masters' despicable character, abusive behaviour and 
unconscionable betrayal. 
I don't possess any information about Judith's life before she mistakenly 
arrived at this house of horrors, but I know indisputably that her story holds 
true for innumerable dogs at this very moment. I never met Judith, but her 
tragic beginning implores me to give her a voice, while her heart wrenching image 
propels me to continue advocating on behalf of innocent animals awaiting 
justice. 
Try, if you can, to imagine where you were ten years ago. Remember your 
surroundings, daily activities, ongoing interactions and aspirations. Consider how 
many days and hours you have passed in this decade filled with countless 
experiences and unforgettable memories. 
Now envision yourself restrained by a cold, steel chain bound to your neck 
condemning you to an uninhabitable wooden dog house for ten torturous years. 
This was the life of Judith . . . and of many others like her. </content>
