Athens -- As it struggles to complete its odyssey of pre- Olympics primping, 
this scraggly city finds itself pressed to prove more than its ability to pave 
roads, plant trees and prettify monuments. 
It has to show that it hasn't gone to the dogs. 
They are legion, and they are leashless. Strays saunter through public 
squares, tails wagging or teeth bared, depending on their dispositions and the 
nearness of meaty alms. Strays flank the gilded portals to fancy boutiques like 
furry, four-legged doormen with a naked hankering for table scraps. 
In an unfortunate, widely publicized incident last summer, one stray bit a 
Ukrainian archery coach who was in Athens for Olympic test events and out for a 
run. 
The wound was not serious, except to the scruffy image of Athens and its 
environs, whose caretakers are now trying, in a manner that might well be 
described as dogged, to tame the situation. 
Just a few months ago the national government enacted legislation meant to 
reduce the stray population by holding Greeks more accountable, with toughened 
pet registration requirements and stiff fines for abandoning their pets to the 
streets. 
People here apparently do that with some regularity, which city officials 
describe as the principal source of the problem. 
Athens, for its part, is funneling about $2 million this year into new animal 
shelters, more animal control officers and a major sterilization project. 
Stray by randy stray, dogs are being rounded up, neutered and then -- 
if they are not adopted in two weeks -- set free to roam anew, but in a less 
reproductive fashion. 
City officials concede that those combined efforts will not work fast enough 
to make a major difference by the beginning of the Olympic Games on Aug. 13, 
but they say there may be some benefit. </content>
