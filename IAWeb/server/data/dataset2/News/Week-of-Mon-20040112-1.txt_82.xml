    More than 100 monkeys were involved in experiments at the University of 
Utah between October 1998 and February 2003. Some primates were as young as 6 
months old. 
    But good luck finding out what was done to them. 
    The school's attorney says that information, and the researchers who 
gather it, should be protected -- from public disclosure, from curious competitors 
and from people such as Jeremy Beckham. 
    Beckham, 18, a freshman and budding biologist is, nonetheless, upset 
about animal testing. Taxpayers would be, too, Beckham insists, if they knew what 
was taking place in laboratories funded with federal grants and state money, 
like those at the U. 
    Last fall, Beckham filed an open-records request for research protocols 
containing blow-by-blow descriptions of experiments involving primates, 
including what anesthesia is used on the animals, whether they are restrained, and 
what kind of post-operative care they receive. 
    Beckham plans to publish the information on his Web site. The ultimate 
goal, he says, is to generate enough public outrage that the school ends 
experimentation on baboons, macaques, marmosets and other monkeys. In October, he 
founded the Utah Primate Freedom Project. The Web site describes it as "a 
collection of concerned university students, alumni and laypersons," but that's a bit 
overstated. 
    "Right now, it's me and a couple of friends," Beckham says. 
    That's apparently enough to make the university nervous.</content>
