KGB agents in scuba gear used to swim under Nikita Khrushchev's boat, putting 
fish on his hook. They used to chain wild boars to trees so Leonid Brezhnev 
could blast them with his hunting rifle; they used to hide behind trees to 
throw furry little rabbits out for Brezhnev to peer at through his thick 
eyeglasses and gun down.

Which brings us to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, who took Air Force Two 
last week to an exclusive Pennsylvania club for some sport -- Brezhnev-style. 
No boars chained to trees, no trembling pages clutching trembling rabbits to 
chuck like grenades into the line of fire. Just hundreds of clueless, 
farm-raised ring-necked pheasants, all held under nets until the vice president and 
his Texas Republican friends (investment bankers, a senator, former Dallas 
Cowboys football star Roger Staubach) are in position.
Then the nets are lifted, the birds started and the gunfire opened. Cheney 
bagged more than 70; hundreds all told were killed. A senator who participated 
joked it was more like working at a poultry-processing plant than hunting. An 
outdoor writer compared it to "going to the grocery store and buying chicken." 
Animal rights activists called it slaughter for fun. The editor of Field &amp; 
Stream shrugged, "I don't think it should be confused with hunting."
But whether it's Cheney or Chernomyrdin, hunting this way is quick. Cheney's 
birds were plucked and vacuum-packed in time for his flight that afternoon to 
Washington (where, the official story goes, they were given to the poor). 
Cheney had no comment for the press, but you could easily imagine him echoing 
Chernomyrdin: "I was happy that I had an opening in my schedule for this. I 
love hunting. There is no other recreation that I can afford. I am always short 
of time."</content>
