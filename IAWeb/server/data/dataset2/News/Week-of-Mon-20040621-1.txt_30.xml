Lori Lehner, who played a central role in the infamous "Silver Spring
monkeys" case when she opened her house to 17 laboratory monkeys in
1981, died of leukemia June 2 in Tampa. She was 45 and had lived in
Florida since 1997.

By outfitting her basement in Rockville as a temporary refuge for the
monkeys, Ms. Lehner helped set in motion the celebrated case, which led
to a decade of legal and scientific wrangling and propelled the newly
formed People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals into the most
powerful and controversial group in the animal rights movement.

Ms. Lehner had studied to be an actress, but she found herself on an
especially bright public stage when Montgomery County police raided a
Silver Spring laboratory on Sept. 11, 1981, and seized 17 monkeys from
the Institute for Behavioral Research.
