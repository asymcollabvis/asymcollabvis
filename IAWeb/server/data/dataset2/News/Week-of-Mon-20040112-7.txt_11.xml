(Univera, which derives soaps, cosmetics and dietary supplements from aloe 
vera, received no special tax breaks to move to Lacey. It plans to start with 40 
employees -- some from the Colorado base, some new hires from South Sound -- 
in a temporary Hawks Prairie building by July and expand to 150 on a bigger 
37-acre campus nearby within three years.) 
 
As the courting process continued, Shin said, company officials grew more 
enchanted with how eager South Sound economic development officials were to 
recruit Univera. 
"After a time, they said this is a clean, friendly, pro-business state," Shin 
said. 
In its work, Univera does some product testing on mice, said Derek Hall, its 
chief operating officer. For example, the company tests weight-loss and 
diabetic products on mice, he said. 
"We do test on mice to make sure we don't kill somebody," Hall said. "We 
don't do testing on any other animals." 
Hall said the belief that Washington was more interested in recruiting 
Univera than Oregon and California ultimately led to Lacey's being the winning 
location. 
"You go where you feel you're wanted," he said.</content>
