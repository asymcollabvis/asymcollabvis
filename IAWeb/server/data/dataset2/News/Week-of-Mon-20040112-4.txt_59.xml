  <content>It was the kind of day where you don't take your gloves off too long or you 
will start to lose feeling in your fingers, but the bison didn't seem to mind. 
Standing just inside the glass door to the gift shop, Paul Ciaglo pointed past 
the pen where his bison were huddled to a hayfield across a depression. 
Barren now in winter, the 18-acre lot is where he and his brother Fred hope a new 
Lowe's home improvement store will be built. But first, voters in Hadley will 
have to agree to redraw the current business zone, which only extends 500 feet 
back from Route 9. 
It's by no means a foregone conclusion. The past six months have seen Hadley 
residents voice questions about the need for more "big box" retailers on 
traffic-clogged Route 9. Two previous town meetings have blocked the rezoning 
effort, which needs a two-thirds majority to pass. But the Ciaglos hope that the 
third time -- this Saturday, Jan. 17 -- will be the charm. More is on the line 
for them than just money. When they inked a deal with Paradigm Development 
Inc., they promised the developer retail-ready land one way or the other. So if 
the rezone effort fails, they will sell the whole farm. 
As Paul Ciaglo looked out at his young herd, he explained that bison can live 
for 30 years or more. The farm currently holds about 65 head of bison. While 
he said 10 to 15 bison are slaughtered a year for the meat, breeding stock are 
retained. The oldest bison on the farm right now is about 10 years old.</content>
