Dutchess nuzzled my face, breathing sweet, warm air on my cold cheeks, 
tousling my hair. She liked me.
My heart thumped. City girls don't get many chances to snuggle with 
standardbred mares and probably couldn't get this close to an unfamiliar sighted horse. 
Standing under the muzzle of a blind one felt like an intrusion, but Dutchess 
caressed the moment. She indulged me.
``She is an extremely confident horse,'' said Annette Fisher, her rescuer, 
benefactor, ``mom.''
She and I chatted softly so Dutchess could monitor our location. After she 
endured years as a castaway of the animal kingdom, her hooves finally struck 
friendly soil. She has escaped the hatchets of the meat processors not once, but 
twice. ``The fact that somebody would euthanize her because they didn't want 
to care for the horse is amazing,'' said Jana Tuckerman, a vet in equine 
practice. ``It's irresponsible to take a blind mare to the slaughter house.''</content>
