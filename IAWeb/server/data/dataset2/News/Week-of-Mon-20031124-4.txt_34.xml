Two decades after their son?s death, a York County family still worries about 
the boy who shot him. 
Don and Anne Coe's son, Roger Coe, was killed more than two decades ago when 
a 12-year-old boy slipped on some underbrush and shot him through the heart. A 
quarter of Pennsylvania's hunting accidents are caused by hunters under the 
age of 18.
More than 25 years ago, Don Coe received one of the worst phone calls of his 
life. 
His daughter-in-law?s pastor called to inform him that his youngest son had 
died. 
?It?s a thing you never forget,? he said. 
Coe?s son, Roger, a young minister, a husband and brand-new father of a baby 
girl, had been killed in a hunting accident in Juniata County. A 12-year-old 
boy in his hunting party carried the gun that killed him. 
?The boy slipped and fell,? Don Coe said. ?His gun went off and shot our son 
through the heart. He died instantly. Both safeties were off.? 
The circumstances surrounding Roger Coe?s accident did not surprise Eric 
Nuse, executive vice president of the International Hunter Education Association. 
About a quarter of hunting accidents nationally and in Canada involve hunters 
under the age of 19. 
?I think the main thing is,? Nuse said, ?they?re less experienced.? 
In some studies, he said, hunters between the ages of 12 and 16, when 
accompanied by an adult and hunting small game, were actually the safest group. 
?That kind of points to the strength or value of having a good mentor with a 
junior hunter,? he said. 
Two things have to go wrong, Nuse said, before any hunter becomes injured in 
an accident: someone has to point the muzzle of their weapon in the wrong 
direction and the safety must not be engaged. 
?In my experience, that?s where a lot of the youth injuries occur,? he said. 
?Careless handling.? </content>
