  <content>Starting  next month Habitat for Horses 
will become the first nonprofit equine rescue  group in America to use 
contraceptives for its domestic female  horses.

The contraceptives are a pre-emptive move for the organization to  guard 
against over-breeding of domestic horses, which leads to large numbers of  equines 
being slaughtered each year, said Jerry Finch, founder and president of  
Habitat for Horses.

Two slaughterhouses in Texas kill about 1,200 horses  a week, said Finch. The 
horses that end up in the slaughterhouses are usually  the domestic grade 
equines commonly found in backyards with no  registration.

?Auctioneers buy them for $300 to $600,? said  Finch.

That horsemeat is then shipped to countries such as Belgium,  France, Asia, 
Italy and Japan. Habitat for Horses is one of 200 groups waiting  for a 
congressional bill to move out of the agricultural committee in Washington  that 
would outlaw the sale of horsemeat. 

So far, the group?s efforts to  move that bill out of committee have been 
unsuccessful, said Finch, who worries  that if it isn?t moved in two weeks it 
will die.
