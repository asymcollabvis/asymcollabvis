Pets being used as tool to keep members in line

There is a growing body of evidence linking animal abuse and family
violence, and those who take care of the victims of both say they believe
that learning more about that connection will prompt more people to take
notice and take action.

The Coastal Women's Shelter and the Colonial Capital Humane Society have
aligned themselves with a national initiative, "Animal Cruelty IS Family
Violence," launched by the Humane Society of the United States to raise
awareness of the connection during 2004 Animal Cruelty/Human Violence
Awareness Week, which begins today.
