The state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) determined that 
botulism caused 70 geese and ducks to die at local retention basins. "It's 
avian botulism, which is [caused by] a [bacterium]," said Jack Kaskey, a DEP 
spokesman, Friday. "It is not a health threat to people." 

The determination came from blood samples investigators took from sick birds 
at the 3 basins near Delsea Drive and Sarah Place.  The basins, which are 3 
feet deep, are located behind Lilliston Ford and Luther Acres, a senior 
housing complex.

The birds' deaths last week prompted concerns and a DEP investigation. 
Kaskey said conditions in the shallow basins were perfect for fostering 
increased levels of the bacteria, noting that botulism naturally occurs in 
bodies of water.
