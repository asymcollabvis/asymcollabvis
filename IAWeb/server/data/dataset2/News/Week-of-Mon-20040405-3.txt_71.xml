Bounty can mean "plentiful" or "that which is freely given," as well as 
referring to the price on the head of an animal. Related to other upbeat words such 
as "bountiful," way back when it came to us from the Latin word "bonitas," 
which meant "goodness" or "kindness." All true, but if you were a coyote in 
southeast Ohio these days, the word's origins might seem a little ironic.

The coyote, or Canis latrans, also has been called "God's dog." 
Native-American cultures have long revered him as a form of "the Trickster." Tricksters are 
common throughout the world's mythologies. They are spiritual beings who are 
at once sacred and profane, often using practical jokes to teach us simple 
folk a few needed lessons in common sense and humility.

Coyotes are good-sized critters, smaller than wolves, bigger than foxes. They 
are omnivores and will truly eat almost anything. When they hunt, they do not 
hunt in packs like wolves, but instead will often shoot themselves out of 
giant slingshots to catch wily prey. (OK, that part is not really true.)

The coyote population has been growing in the East and Midwest for years now. 
On average, the Eastern ones are a bit bigger than their Western kin. Most 
wildlife biologists think that they have slowly been expanding their range 
eastward ever since we started converting the Appalachian forests to fields over 
200 years ago. Others think they have been here all along, albeit in smaller 
numbers. However long they've been here, they play an important role now, and 
probably help Ohio farmers more than they'd ever hurt them, by keeping rodent and 
rabbit populations under control.</content>
