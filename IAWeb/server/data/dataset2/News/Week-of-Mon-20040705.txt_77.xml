THE PLAZA - It starts with a parade winding down H Street. From day to
day, the numbers of participants vary, but the impromptu music, composed
with empty paint buckets, pans and wooden spoons, containers of
home-made vegetarian food and festive atmosphere are constant. As the
procession nears the Plaza, its arrival is gleefully proclaimed: "Food
Not Bombs!" The event takes place every Friday, Saturday and Sunday
between 5 and 6 p.m., and lately on Wednesdays, too.

The purpose is a simple one: providing food to those who need it. "It?s
like a potluck or a picnic - we?re just sharing food with friends,"
explained Miguel, a volunteer with the Arcata chapter of Food Not Bombs
(FNB).
Feeding the hungry

Food Not Bombs, a worldwide movement started in Cambridge, Mass. in
1980, is based on the premise that human life should be valued over
material wealth, and that poverty is a form of violence. The group
serves warm vegetarian and vegan meals in public parks to all comers,
feeding the hungry - often with food that would otherwise have gone to a
landfill - and drawing attention to issues of poverty, inequality and
waste.
