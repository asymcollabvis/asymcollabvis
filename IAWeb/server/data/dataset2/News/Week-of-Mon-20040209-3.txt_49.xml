To ensure workers at poultry farms are not ex-posed to possible avian flu, 
the Cab-inet has roped in the Human Re-sources Ministry.

Human Resources Minister Datuk Dr Fong Chan Onn said his ministry would work 
closely with the Agri-culture, Home, Health and Defence ministries.

"Our role will be to protect workers against the disease," he said after 
chairing the ministry's post-Cabinet meeting today.

He said all workers at bird farms must strictly abide by the directive issued 
by the Department of Occupational Safety and Health to wear protective gear 
at all times when handling birds.

"This directive also applies to those in wet markets, zoos and shops," he 
said, adding that so far, the depart-ment had checked 75 farms and all had 
adhered to the guidelines and directives.

He said DOSH enforcement offi-cers in all States have been told to check bird 
farms and shops and submit a report.

Fong said complacency over the threat of bird flu and other such contagions 
could lead to a RM50,000 fine and three-year jail term under the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act 1994.

"No one can afford to be complacent. It's important that everyone co-operate 
to ensure that our farms and workers are free of the deadly dis-ease," he said.</content>
