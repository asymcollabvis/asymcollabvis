Ground beef is suspect, farmed salmon has PCBs. Veal fell from grace in 
the'70s, Atlantic swordfish is a no-no, tuna has mercury. 
We're told to avoid pork raised on factory farms, trawl-harvested shrimp, 
hormone-laced milk. 
Even the blandest of alternatives -- tofu -- comes from genetically modified 
soybeans. 
And let's not get started on bottled water. 
A conscientious eater can be forgiven for feeling that a simple trip to the 
supermarket is fraught with peril. Last month's disclosures about mad cow 
disease had barely faded from the front pages when scientists announced Thursday 
that farmed salmon should be eaten no more than six times a year. 
What's next? 
"When it comes to food, ignorance is not bliss," said Michael Straus, 
president of Straus Communications, a San Francisco-based consulting firm 
specializing in organic products and environmental issues. 
"The food system is complicated and not as straightforward. ... When you go 
to a fast-food restaurant and buy a burger, there's a lot going on, and very 
few people want to know until there's a problem." 
Federal food and agriculture agencies -- and many scientists -- insist the 
food on our plates is safe, be it an organic tomato, a genetically modified corn 
tortilla, a Tyson chicken breast or a Niman Ranch lamb chop. 
But then they note the fine print: Mercury levels in tuna are borderline 
enough that scientists suggest pregnant and nursing mothers limit consumption. </content>
