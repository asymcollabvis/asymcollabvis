Thanks to all of your kind hearts we have taken over half of the piggy angels 
off the tree. With a few days yet to go we are hoping they will All be 
chosen!  What lucky piggies to have such friends.
 
With snow on the ground and the thermometer sitting at 20 degrees this 
morning I am glad that everyone here has a warm bed.. with so much hay they can lose 
themselves in it.. We put out about 30 bales last weekend and yesterday I put 
out another 40. 
 
If you know of any pigs who do not have a suitable house or bedding please 
email .. we will try to get some help to them. There are several organizations 
now who are doing the Helping Hoof program so when you see pigs in need email 
me and I will pass it along to Tammy or Lana or whomever might be closest. And 
any sanctuary will help a pig in need.. it doesn't have to have a formal 
program.. What we couldn't dream of doing alone, together we make happen every 
day.... just for the love of pigs. And all of you who are part of the Helping Hoof 
program are the reason it works.. may you find a special joy in your heart 
this Christmas, knowing that some pig somewhere is safe because of your caring..
