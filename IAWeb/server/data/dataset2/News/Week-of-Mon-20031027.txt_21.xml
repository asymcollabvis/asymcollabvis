A northwest Iowa farmer last week shot and killed a mountain lion, the first 
confirmed shooting of one of the animals in the state in more than a century. 
Russ Gradert of Ireton was doing field work Thursday when he saw the animal.
"We were finishing up combining the corn rows when we saw him go back into 
the corn rows," said Gradert, who was with his cousins Warren and Brian Gradert. 
"We finished up and went back out and shot it. This was the first time I saw 
a lion outside of a zoo."
The mountain lion, which was shot with a high-powered rifle, weighed about 
113 pounds and had a full set of teeth and claws.
Richard Bishop, wildlife bureau chief of the Iowa Department of Natural 
Resources, said officials have expected an increase in mountain lion sightings. 
"These animals are getting pushed out of their environments and are 
continuing to look for new habitats," he said.
According to Bishop, mountain lions once roamed Iowa but were pushed out of 
the state as it became more populated.
"We eliminated them, as well as several other animals, because we just 
couldn't handle them," Bishop said. "We just shot them. We basically persecuted 
them. At that time there were no game laws, and they were a potential threat to 
people."
