WASHINGTON ? They are bombing buildings; sending death threats; committing
arson, extortion, burglary and sabotage; and urging followers to wage war
along with them.

The Bush administration said Tuesday that those activities qualify extreme
animal-rights activists as terrorists, and Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch agreed. But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the
committee's ranking Democrat, scoffed at that.

"Most Americans would not consider the harassment of animal testing
facilities to be 'terrorism' any more than they would consider
anti-globalism protesters or anti-war protesters or women's health
activists to be terrorists," Leahy said in a statement for a hearing on
animal rights extremists

The owners of Kentucky Fried Chicken also asked Hatch not just to protect
animal researchers but companies that produce or sell meat. They are
targeted by less extreme groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals.

Jonathan Blum, senior vice president of KFC's parent company, Yum! Brands,
said harassment and threats from PETA have left many KFC executives to
seek around-the-clock police protection.
