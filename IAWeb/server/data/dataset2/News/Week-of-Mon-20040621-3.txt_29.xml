Two Billings television stations have pulled advertisements by the
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals that showed graphic images
of animal processing and a message advocating vegetarianism.

Officials from the Montana Stockgrowers Association met with managers at
KSVI (ABC) and KHMT (Fox) on Wednesday to protest the commercial's
images and messages, said Tamara Beardsley, communications coordinator
for stock growers group.

"We requested they take them off the air because of the fact that they
are misleading," Beardsley said Thursday. "We thought it was our job to
let them know these advertisements were not accurate."

The ads - part of PETA's "Go Vegetarian" campaign - were scheduled to
run more than 250 times starting Monday until July 18. The ads ran
several times this week before being taken off the air.
