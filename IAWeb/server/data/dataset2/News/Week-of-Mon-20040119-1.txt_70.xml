Volunteers who raise money for the RSPCA have criticised the decision to 
close the charity's dog rehoming centre near Diss. 

They have been told, by the RSPCA's Norwich and Mid-Norfolk branch, that the 
dogs are being moved to another boarding facility, north of the city, for 
financial reasons. 

However, the Diss volunteers claim it would be less costly to continue 
running the facility at the Heywood. 

They are also in dispute with the charity over staffing levels at its Paws 
centre in Norwich, and claim money raised is spent on administration rather than 
animal welfare. 

Carla Crisp, the RSPCA's Diss volunteers co-ordinator, said: "If cost-cutting 
is the main reason for removing the dogs, surely Diss kennels is the better 
and much cheaper option?

"There are no paid staff on the premises, so experienced volunteers carry out 
front of house duties as well as walk, groom and socialise the dogs on a 
daily basis.

"Obviously, this means that monies donated can be spent on dogs and not 
staff."

She said people should think carefully before donating their "hard-earned 
cash", adding that there were many other local charities involved in animal 
welfare, which would welcome a contribution. </content>
