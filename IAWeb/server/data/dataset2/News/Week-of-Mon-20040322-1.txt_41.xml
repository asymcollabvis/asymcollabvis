The first rodeo competition is thought to have been held in Cheyenne,
Wyo., more than a hundred years ago. With all the hoopla surrounding
RodeoHouston -- the world's largest -- and news that general attendance
set a new record this year, the event seems poised to flourish for at
least another hundred.

But don't count on it.

Animal advocates across the board are determined to see that this American
tradition, at least as we know it today, becomes American history.

From the controversial People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to
mainstream organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States,
animal-interest groups are working to end the use of animals in circuses
and rodeos. Their investigative work and media savvy have caused others to
take notice, and the cause is picking up support.

A referendum to ban the display of wild or exotic animals is on the ballot
this year in Denver. If it's successful, the city will be the largest in
the United States to pass such a measure. The zoo, aquarium and rodeo were
excluded from the proposed ban, but circuses with animals and other types
of menageries would be prohibited from setting up there.

In 2004, the animal crusade in Houston is stronger than ever before.
Houston has two organized animal-rights groups based here, numerous animal
welfare/protection organizations and a vegan/animal-rights radio show
working to raise awareness about the plight of animals. Activists have
demonstrated at some of the rodeo shows this year, waving signs that read
"Animal Abuse is Not Entertainment and Buck the Rodeo!" and "The Animals
Lose Every Time" at buses entering Reliant Park.</content>
