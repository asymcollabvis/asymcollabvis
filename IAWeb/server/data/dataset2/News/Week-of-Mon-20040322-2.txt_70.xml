  <content>Nine lives, nine months. One's a myth, one's the age of an 
angel. 
Cats, it is said, possess nine lives. Not true, although it sometimes seems a 
fact as they wile their way from disaster to disaster with nary a scratch. 
Emily Douglas is 9-months old, a documented fact. Now, Emily is in possession 
of one cat, Wilmington, which, if the myth is true, has eight lives left in 
reserve after happening on a knight in shining Huggies.
Emily is the daughter of Bob Douglas, Wilmington's new conservation agent, a 
title which, until last week, did not normally extend to felines of any 
vintage or life number. Now, after three kittens were found alone and abandoned on 
the steps of Town Hall, conservation agent may well extend to those remaining 
eight lives multiplied by three. After all, Wilmington the cat, Wilma for 
short, came from that box and owes at least some of her remaining time to Douglas 
and his family.
