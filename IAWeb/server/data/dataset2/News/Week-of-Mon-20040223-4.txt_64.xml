  <content>Dan Koons learned the bad news Dec. 
23 just like everyone else, but his reaction was more intense than most. 
Koons, who raises beef cattle at Funk Farms Trust near Shirley, was watching 
TV news when he heard that a 6-year-old Holstein dairy cow in Washington state 
had tested positive for mad cow disease. 
"I felt sick," said Koons, who has raised cattle his entire life. "We'd just 
come through two or three tough years. Demand was up. Supplies were shrinking. 
"I had sold cattle for $1.06 per pound in November. It helped pay off the 
damage of the last two or three years. It just knocks you off your feet." 
Mad cow disease was never considered a possible terrorist threat because the 
disease is not contagious among cattle. However, its occurrence reinforced a 
strengthening message of security for the nation's agricultural industry that 
feeds the United States and the world. 
And it showed how a threat to the food system can cause havoc. 
The mad cow confirmation caused live cattle futures prices to plummet from 
92.35 cents per pound Dec. 23 to 73.52 cents per pound seven days later. Prices 
now hover in the 75 cents per pound range.
