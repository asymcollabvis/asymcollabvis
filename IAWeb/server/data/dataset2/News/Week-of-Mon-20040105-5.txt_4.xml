Spanning nearly a century, the National Western Stock Show, Rodeo and Horse 
Show remains quite a draw among the Stetson crowd: last year, more than 640,000 
people moseyed through Denver's stockyards during the 16-day event. 
But for Colorado's newcomers, or, say, the more urbanly inclined, navigating 
the 100-acre stock show can be a little intimidating. 




In addition to huge crowds, there are some 15,000 animals ? everything from 
cattle, swine and bison to yaks and llamas ? as well as nearly 400 vendors and 
dozens of performances, ranging from Mexican rodeo extravaganzas to freestyle 
reining and bucking bulls. 
Confronted with such a cornucopia of Western life and tradition, it can be a 
little hard to know where to begin. The fiddle contest? Perhaps the goat show? 
Maybe the dog agility games? How about that service by the Fellowship of 
Christian Cowboys? </content>
