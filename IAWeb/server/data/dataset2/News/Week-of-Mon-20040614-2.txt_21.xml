MADISON, Wis. -- A 19-year-old Salt Lake City man is on a mission to try
to shut down eight primate research centers across the country,
including the one operating in Madison.

Jeremy Beckham is traveling across the nation trying to educate the
public about the cruelty of primate research. Beckham claims when
primates live in steel cages all of their lives, it causes them to harm
themselves. But researchers disagree, saying there is no maltreatment of
these primates.

Experts at the UW Primate Center in Madison say when people see images
of cruelty to animals it's important to understand the context of the
situation.
