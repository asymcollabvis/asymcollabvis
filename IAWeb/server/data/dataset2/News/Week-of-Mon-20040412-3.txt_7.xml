  <content>When the nation's largest circus rolls into the state
capital at the end of the month with its gigantic Asian elephants in tow,
it will be met with a proposed law seeking to regulate the treatment of
elephants in captivity.

Elephants displayed at circuses, petting zoos, carnivals and parades are
currently subject to federal and state animal welfare rules. Some New York
lawmakers want to go a step further by strengthening state regulations
specific to elephants and imposing punishment on animal handlers and
others who violate the law.

The bill before the state Legislature would require that elephants
transported into New York be kept in temperature-controlled, ventilated
trailers. It also mandates that elephants have their legs unchained for at
least an hour a day excluding the time that the animal is on display.
...
Last year, the Maine Legislature passed a compromise law requiring state
agricultural officials to adopt rules consistent with federal standards on
the treatment and care of circus elephants. Some lawmakers initially
favored banning circuses and traveling shows in Maine because they felt
the animals were abused in captivity.</content>
