  <content>Law-enforcement agencies investigating the mutilation of two 
seals last summer say they have two prime suspects in the case - and possibly 
another mutilated seal. 
A reward fund for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators, 
established in November, has reached $7,850 and is still growing. 
In July and August last year, a harbor seal and a gray seal washed up on the 
shores of Hampton Beach. Both had been skinned and their male genitalia were 
removed. 
Last week, a third seal - also skinned - was found in the waters off Kittery, 
Maine, by a veterinarian. A necropsy is being performed at the New England 
Aquarium to determine if the case is related. 
A total of five seal carcasses have been discovered in the investigation into 
the poaching case. Only two could be positively identified to fit the crime. 
The other carcasses were too badly decomposed to be sure. 
Chris Shoppmeyer, a special agent for the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
said at the time that all five deaths were considered suspicious and that the 
work was that of a professional. 
"They were skinned, with no damage to internal organs," he said. "Whoever did 
this is skilled with a knife." 
Shoppmeyer said the genitalia have a high market value overseas, where they 
are considered to be an aphrodisiac. 
In a news conference on Friday afternoon, U.S. Attorney Tom Colantuono said 
his office is working closely with the other agencies involved to secure an 
arrest. 
"We have received some information from the public that has been helpful," he 
said. "The case has not been solved yet, so we are asking for additional 
public help." </content>
