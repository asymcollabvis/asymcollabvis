Dr Reddin outlined an ongoing feral cat control programme under his 
leadership.

There will be a more public direction, notably, the expansion of the well 
received website www.kangaroo-island-world.com/cats/catnews which was set up by 
local Mr Mal Ellson.

Dr Reddin spoke of KICCC's successful liaison with government agencies which 
have supported a public education 'Responsible Cat Ownership' stand at the 
Kingscote Agricultural Show in 2003, scientific research and funding of on-ground 
control measures.

He also mentioned toxoplasmosis-related human reproductive problems, and the 
need to maintain epidemiological surveillance.

The trapping sub-committee, led by Mr Barry Green, tabled numbers of 144 
feral cat control events, from which nearly 50 feral cats have been analysed for 
toxoplasmosis titres which have shown an alarming rate of more than 90% 
positive result.

He acknowledged and thanked the observation and reporting of over 22 
individual contributors to the tally.

The committee is aware of many anecdotal feral cat control events, and in 
keeping with required scientific vigour, has begun collecting and collating basic 
information from these cat control events.

KICCC would welcome your contribution.

Guest speaker, Mr Michael Johnson, a Victorian scientist, described the 
arduous development of a combination of chemicals to formulate a humane, felid 
specific toxicant, with an illustrated talk of his work on fax-free, feral 
cat-infested French Island.

There is still some way to go, but a liquid toxin in a hard pellet has proved 
most successful for feral cat control.
