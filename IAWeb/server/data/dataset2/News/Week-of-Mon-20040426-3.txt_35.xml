EWING - The head of the township health department and a former animal
control official yesterday were charged in connection with the killing of
20 cats in their care at the Ingham Avenue animal shelter in October.

The New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals filed 20
counts of "procuring the needless killing of an animal" against township
Health Officer Albert Leff and 20 counts each of "needlessly killing an
animal" and "abusing a living animal" against David E. Smith of 7th
Street, a retired animal control officer brought in by the township when
its regular officer refused to do the killing.
