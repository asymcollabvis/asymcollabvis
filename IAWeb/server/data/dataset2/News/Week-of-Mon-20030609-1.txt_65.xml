In 2001, Eric Schlosser published "Fast Food Nation" ? an expose of
America's increasingly consolidated and industrialized food system,
and how that system contributes to a whole range of societal ills,
from obesity and resistance to antibiotics to urban sprawl, habitat
destruction, and poor labor conditions. The book was a smashing
success ? 66 weeks and running on the New York Times bestseller list
? and it captured the nation's attention in a way no book about food
has since Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, the 1906 classic about the
Chicago meatpacking industry.

Two new books are riding the same wave of interest in food that
launched "Fast Food Nation" to bestseller status. Marion Nestle's
Safe Food: Bacteria, Biotechnology, and Bioterrorism chronicles a
recent rise in food-borne illness and consumer distrust of food
companies such as Monsanto, and describes the downside of an
increasingly homogenized food marketplace.</content>
