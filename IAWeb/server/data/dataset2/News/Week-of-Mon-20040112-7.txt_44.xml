A US fertility specialist flew into Britain yesterday to announce that he had 
transferred the first cloned embryo into a woman - but he refused to give a 
shred of evidence to back up his astonishing boast. 
With theatrical flair, Dr Panos Zavos, an IVF expert from Kentucky, told a 
packed press conference in London that he had created the first cloned 
pregnancy. He said that he had taken a skin cell from a man and fused it with the egg 
of a 35-year-old woman and that in two weeks' time they would know whether a 
full pregnancy was safely established. 
His announcement was greeted with laughter and disbelief. A scientist 
compared it to recent claims by the alien-loving Raelian sect, who say they have 
created cloned babies. 
No details were given to corroborate Zavos's claim. All he would say is that 
it happened outside Europe and the US and that it took place within the last 
fortnight. </content>
