  <content>Loran Balvanz has figured out how to make a silk purse from a sow's 
rear.
Global Resource Recovery Organization, headquartered on State Road 70, has 
entered into an agreement with Iowa-based United Suppliers Inc. to build a 
$650,000 swine confinement facility in Hardin County, Iowa, that will be like no 
other. Swine waste will be turned into a value-added product that can be sold 
for a profit: high-quality organic fertilizer. The goal is to create a better 
environment for animals and neighbors.
The technology has applications for Florida dairy farmers, paper mills and 
municipalities dealing with sludge disposal issues, Balvanz said.
Balvanz's achievement is no laughing matter, but among Iowa's swine farmers, 
the jokes abound. They have to deal with the stench of swine manure, a smell 
that causes feuds between neighbors and permeates clothing and the skin.
"You wouldn't last two seconds in there," Balvanz said.
The smell of waste from dairy farms on hot summer days is familiar to 
residents living in East Manatee along Upper Manatee River Road. His new technology 
has the potential to cut down those problems.
Balvanz's Tempest Drying System will reduce the odor problems by more than 50 
percent and eliminate the need for lagoons and under-building storage of </content>
