- It might seem quiet to the person walking by.

Make laps around the track in Roosevelt Park and you might hear a scream or a 
wail. No, there is not a grand party inside.

The language of the animal world, however, has been subdued because its 
audience has chosen to do other things. The Roosevelt Park Zoo is closed to the 
public during the winter, but life goes on inside. There are just no spectators. 
Workers do make sure the inmates don't get too lonely.

Just don't get too close to that cage or that gibbon, the ape without a tail. 
It might take a swipe. Right now, it's stretched out along the bars. Anything 
to reduce the boredom. Or maybe it just does want to take that swipe. 
Something to reduce the boredom. Or maybe it's just seeking the attention of today's 
guests with the ones from summer gone.

Most animals are inside for the year. You would think the penguins would be 
out skidding on ice. But they're black-footed penguins, pansies who are from a 
patch of islands off the tip of South Africa. They want warmth.
