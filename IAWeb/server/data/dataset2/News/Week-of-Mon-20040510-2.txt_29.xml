Legislation to control violent animal rights extremists is to be
toughened, the government said yesterday as the National Association of
Pension Funds said it might offer a reward for information that puts
ringleaders behind bars.

Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, rejected biotechnology industry
calls for a single piece of new legislation to combat animal extremism but
said additions to existing public order laws would be announced soon.

"There is going to be new legislation - but the extent is still to be
decided," he told the Lords. "Government is not convinced by a single
piece of legislation because it probably is going to be too slow to
implement. He said the government planned to identify key problems
legislate by attaching them to another bill. "Animal research must go
ahead," he said.
