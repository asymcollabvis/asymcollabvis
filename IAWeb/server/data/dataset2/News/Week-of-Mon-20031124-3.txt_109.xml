Hefty fines and other tougher penalties await Marlborough dog owners who 
breach new dog control laws which come into force on Monday. 

Fines of up to $1000 are a feature of the new laws while owners of "menacing" 
dog breeds will need to have them muzzled in public. 
From next week the Marlborough District Council will be enforcing higher 
penalties, including $300 fines for roaming dogs and a $500 fine for people not 
picking up after their dog has pooped in public. 
Council reserves and amenities supervisor Russell Montgomery said the council 
had lobbied hard to have the fines reduced from $500 to $300 for impoundment 
of dogs as well as the removal of "draconian" laws requiring people to fence 
off accessways to their properties. 
He said the laws were now something they could work with but he would have 
liked to see fines a little lower because they would be simply unaffordable for 
many people. 
He said it was now important that dogs had their tags attached because they 
would be impounded otherwise. 
Responsible owners had nothing to fear from the new laws but Mr Montgomery 
said irresponsible people would have to "wake up to the new rules" or face the 
extra expense. 
Blenheim dog owner Karen Middlemiss said she enjoyed walking her dog along 
the Taylor River and did not see any problems with the new laws. She was aware 
of the need to carry a dog lead but said most people she met on her walks would 
carry one anyway if they did not trust their dog to "socialise". 
"We have never had a problem with other dogs down there." 
She said the doggy-do bags provided by the council in designated walking 
areas were good and had made a difference to the state of the walking areas. </content>
