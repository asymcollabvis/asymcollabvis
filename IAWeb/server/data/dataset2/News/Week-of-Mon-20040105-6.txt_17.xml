Meet Brody. He is attractive, friendly, sure to make a good companion -- but 
if no one adopts him within three days, he will be killed. 
According to the Utah County Animal Shelter, pet owners surrendered 2,495 
animals to the shelter last year. Of those pets, 79 percent were euthanized. 
"The number one thing prospective pet owners can do to help prevent homeless 
pets is adopt what they can take care of," said Utah County Animal Shelter 
attendant Jackie Barlow. "Adopting a pet is a lifetime commitment." 
Barlow said the animals that go to homes where owners do not realize the 
importance of their responsibilities often end up in one of several dire 
circumstances: wandering the streets, being abused or being taken back at the shelter 
to be euthanized. 
Barlow said she feels relieved when she puts a chronically ill and miserable 
animal to sleep, but when she has to euthanize a perfectly healthy, adoptable 
animal because of overcrowding, she becomes furious. 
"It really pisses me off," she said. "There are people who I tell, 'You know, 
if you leave this animal here, it will most likely be euthanized,' and they 
say, 'I don't care, let him go.' Those are the ones that piss me off. It's not 
the animal's fault, and it's not our fault. It's the irresponsible pet owner's 
fault."
