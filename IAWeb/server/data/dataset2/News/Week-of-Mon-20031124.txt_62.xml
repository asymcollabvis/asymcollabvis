Keeping predators at bay with flashing lights and loud noises instead of 
bullets
When wolves and other large carnivores threaten people and livestock, 
wildlife managers often resort to killing them. But now there's hope for a non-lethal 
solution to controlling carnivores. New research shows that 
movement-activated guards with strobe lights and sound recordings can help keep wolves and 
bears away. 
"High-technology devices are much more expensive, complicated and limited in 
effectiveness than a single bullet from a high-powered rifle, but they also 
allow a predator to live ? surely the goal of conservation," say John Shivik of 
the United States Department of Agriculture, Wildlife Services, National 
Wildlife Research Center and Utah State University in Logan; Adrian Treves, who did 
this work while at Conservation International in Madison, Wisconsin, and is 
now at the Wildlife Conservation Society in Bronx, New York; and Peggy Callahan 
of the Wildlife Science Center in Forest Lake, Minnesota. 
This work is part of a six-paper special section co-edited by Treves on the 
conflict between people and carnivores in the December issue of Conservation 
Biology. 
Conflicts between people and carnivores are rising as people spread into 
remote habitats and as large carnivores recover from past eradication efforts. 
While wildlife managers often address these conflicts by killing "problem" 
animals, this runs counter to conservation efforts and could impede the recovery of 
rare carnivores. "To promote the existence and expansion of large carnivores, 
conservation biologists should assist with the real-world problems predators 
cause," say the researchers. </content>
