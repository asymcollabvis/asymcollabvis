Guam Animals In Need is organizing a reduced-cost spay and neuter clinic. The 
clinic is scheduled from tomorrow to Feb. 8 at the No Ka Oi Termite and Pest 
Control warehouse located past Happy Mart along Cepeda Way in Radio Barrigada. 
For those residents who want to take advantage of this opportunity, here are 
some notes to remember about the clinic: 
Services are based on first-come, first-serve basis. No appointment is 
necessary. 
The clinic will accept dogs and cats eight weeks and older. 
Dogs and cats in heat or pregnant are accepted. 
Do not feed adult animals after midnight the night before surgery. 
Bring pets between 7 and 8 a.m. 
Have dogs on a leash and cats in a carrier or pillowcase. 
AT A GLANCE 
Spaying and neutering is one of the things we can do to help curb 
overpopulation of unwanted animals. But they also have other benefits: 
Spaying female dogs before their first heat can significantly reduce the risk 
of developing breast and uterine cancers. 
Neutering male dogs reduces roaming up to 60 percent, reduces humping 
behavior and reduces the chances of developing prostate problems. 
Spaying female cats reduces the risk of uterine cancers. 
Neutering male cats reduces, by 90 percent, their tendency to spray while 
indoors.
