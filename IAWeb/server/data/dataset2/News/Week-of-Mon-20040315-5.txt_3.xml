The footage is ugly. 
Palatka Police Department officers have arrived at the scene of a call and 
have been led around to the back yard where two hefty dogs are fighting. The 
black one has latched on to the nape of the brown and white one's neck and is 
swinging its head back and forth in a death grip.
As the owners try to separate the dogs with shovels and water hoses, the 
yelps of the brown and white dog are clearly audible on the police videotape.
Two pit bulls have somehow broken their chains and began doing what they were 
raised to do - fight to the death.
Eventually the dogs are separated. They will have to be put down, but not 
until they go through the court system and the police department is officially 
cleared to do so.
Technically, the raising and fighting of pit bulls is called animal cruelty. 
Officials say it is the biggest, but certainly not the only, problem facing 
the city's understaffed animal control unit.
Wendy Cook served as the animal control officer for about a year, but has 
transferred to another department. She sits on the Putnam County Animal Control 
Board of Directors and lists other major problems as ferral cats, ferral dogs 
and, with summer approaching, animals being left in vehicles while their owners 
run errands.
"Our job is to protect these animals, whether they are ferral, strays, 
whether they are fighting, the ones who are being suffocated in cars," Cook said 
this week.
" We have been labeled animal killers, but that isn't true. We hold 
everything for at least three to five days, and we don't euthanize everything. The are 
so many rescue groups - the humane society, Tracy Varnes, who is right here in 
the county, all over Florida, from out of state. We've had over 2,000 animals 
placed since August." </content>
