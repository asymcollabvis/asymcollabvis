A rise in ecoterrorism is prompting federal and state lawmakers to craft laws 
aimed specifically at radical environmental and animal-rights activists. 
For those wanting to crack down on people who use 
arson and threats of personal violence to force better treatment of animals 
and nature, tougher legal penalties are logical. But to civil libertarians, and 
especially to law-abiding activists, this trend is an attempt to stifle 
legitimate political dissent, including peaceful civil disobedience. That it comes 
at a time of political stress over the war in Iraq, sometimes rough protests 
against international trade agreements, and calls to patriotism is not lost on 
either side. 


Initially, acts of "monkey wrenching" amounted to little more than vandalism 
aimed at such targets as logging equipment and mink farms. In the 1990s, that 
escalated to major arson and bombings. Meanwhile, the range of targets in 
recent months has expanded to include biotechnology firms, SUV dealers, housing 
developments, Wal-Mart stores, and a bottled water plant. 
According to the FBI, there have been some 600 acts of ecoterrorism in the 
United States with property losses totaling nearly $50 million. Speaking of 
recent attacks on biotech firms, Phil Celestini, head of the FBI's domestic 
terrorism unit in Washington, told the Associated Press, "We've seen a drastic 
escalation in the use of violent tactics in the past year." </content>
