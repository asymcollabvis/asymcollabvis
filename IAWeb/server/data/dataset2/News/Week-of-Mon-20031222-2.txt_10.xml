  <content>Japan and South Korea took action to halt imports of U.S.
beef on Wednesday after a cow in Washington state tested positive for mad
cow disease.

Japan's Agriculture Ministry said the country was indefinitely banning
beef imports, depriving American exporters of their largest overseas market.

In Seoul, South Korea, the government halted customs inspection of U.S.
beef, a move that effectively keeps U.S. beef from reaching its domestic
market.

The suspensions came less than four hours after the U.S. government
announced that a Holstein cow on a Washington state farm tested positive
for mad cow disease, marking the disease's first suspected appearance in
the United States.

The Bush administration on Tuesday tried to reassure Americans their food
is safe. 
...
Mad cow disease, known also as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats
holes in the brains of cattle. It sprang up in Britain in 1986 and spread
through countries in Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of
herds and decimating the European beef industry. 
...
With an election year approaching, the news alarmed some in Congress. Rep.
Tim Holden, D-Pa., a member of the House Agriculture Committee, said he
expected Congress to hold "extensive oversight" hearings when lawmakers
return to Washington in late January.

Lawmakers are keenly aware that a case of mad cow disease in Canada last
May ? which officials described as a single, isolated incident ? still had
devastating economic consequences.

"If it's anything like what happened in Canada, it will be bad. The
problem won't be that people will stop eating meat in the United States;
the problem is the exports will be shut down like we did with Canada,"
said Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn. </content>
