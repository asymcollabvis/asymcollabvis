TALLAHASSEE - Scientists think red tide played a part in the deaths of 107 
bottlenose dolphins off the Florida Panhandle this year. 
The scientists are puzzled, however, by some aspects of the latest ``unusual 
mortality event'' of marine mammals. 
The interdisciplinary team, led by scientists from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, said Wednesday that it had analyzed the stomach 
contents of about half the dead dolphins and completed tissue tests on 28 of the 
dead mammals. 
Scientists found high levels of brevetoxins, which are produced by the red 
tide algae, Karenia brevis. 
Lesser levels of domoic acid, another toxin created by microscopic plants, 
were detected in the stomachs, urine and feces of some of the dolphins. 
Domoic acid has been associated with die-offs of California sea lions but 
never with mammal deaths in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The scientists eliminated infectious disease as a cause of death for the 
animals that were autopsied.
