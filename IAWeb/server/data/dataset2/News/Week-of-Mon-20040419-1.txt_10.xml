BESIDES SERVING as an excellent excuse for avoiding family gatherings, the
vegan lifestyle is about more than food. Vegans don't "wear" animals
(wool, fur, leather, down, etc.) and do their damnedest to avoid using
animal products in any form. This is easer said than done. As Howard
Lyman, the cattleman-turned-vegan, says: "To make our choices informed
ones, we have to start with the facts."

Along comes the third edition of Animal Ingredients: A to Z to provide the
facts along with some philosophical and nutritional context, thereby
putting to rest the "where do you get your protein?" canard. But its true
value and power lies in the 2000-plus ingredient listings?more than even
the most seasoned vegan could imagine. While it doesn't require a ton of
initiative to teach oneself to avoid casein, whey or gelatin, who knew the
dirty little secret behind something called lipase? (It's an enzyme from
the "stomach and tongue glands of calves, kids and lambs" found in some
vitamin supplements.)
