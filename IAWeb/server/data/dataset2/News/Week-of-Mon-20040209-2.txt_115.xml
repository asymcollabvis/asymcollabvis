  <content>He began researching nutrition and diets more than 30 years ago, long before 
it became fashionable to talk about low carbs and high fats. 
Dr. David Jenkins, Canada Research Chair in nutrition and metabolism at the 
University of Toronto, began his work at Oxford University in England in 1972, 
when scientists were just beginning to realize the importance of "sticky 
fibres" like oats and barley in cutting cholesterol. 
"I cut my teeth on fibre, and it's been downhill ever since," says Jenkins, 
62, now considered a world leader in nutrition research. 
He came to U of T in 1980 and began looking at foods that are low in glycemic 
index ? pumpernickel and bulgur in particular ? that are useful in keeping 
glucose levels down. 
From there, he moved into "the soy age," exploring why soy products lower 
cholesterol. Then he went on to nuts and found that almonds in particular do the 
same thing. After that, it was plant sterols, which exist in plant oils and 
leafy vegetables and were found to block cholesterol absorption.</content>
