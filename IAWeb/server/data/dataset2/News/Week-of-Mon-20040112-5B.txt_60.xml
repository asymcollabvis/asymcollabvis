Q. We have two mixed-breed dogs in a large, fenced-in area. Right now the 
area is grass, which they like to dig holes in every now and then. With all of 
the running back and forth it gets ruts, and when it rains it all turns to mud.
What is the best material to build a dog run out of? I don't want their paws 
to get hurt, yet I'd like to keep it from getting all muddy. 
A. Compacted dirt or clay with a 4-inch layer of sand covered by a 3- to 
4-inch layer of pea gravel held in place with a low wall of bricks or railroad 
ties makes for a suitable ground cover that drains and dries easily. 
Alternatively, smooth cement or patio-style wood slats, set no more than 1/3-inch apart 
over a layer of sand and rock chips, would be a good, albeit more permanent, 
alternative. Part of the run should ideally be covered to give shade and shelter, 
or you should provide a box-type kennel.</content>
