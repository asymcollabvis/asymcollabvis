  <content>Officials with the US Department of Agriculture are calling for construction 
of a $100 million animal disease research laboratory in Laramie. 
If approved, the new 178,000-square-foot national facility would replace the 
two existing USDA Arthropod-Borne Animal Diseases Research Laboratories 
located in West Laramie and at the University of Wyoming. 
Although it?s still waiting for Congress? approval, the possible expansion 
could mean over 30 new jobs and a $10 million economic impact for Laramie. 
?The community has a lot to gain economically by having a facility like this 
built here,? said Richard Mayer, a research leader with the Laramie 
laboratory. 
Mayer is gathering letters of support and cooperative agreements from several 
state and regional groups, with the hope Congress will fund the lab this 
year. 
The potential project has also been endorsed by the National Cattlemen?s 
Association, Wyoming Stockgrowers Association and the US Animal Health 
Association. 
?I don?t see anything negative about bringing something like this here,? 
Mayer said. ?It would attract new businesses to Laramie and the University of 
Wyoming would be more competitive for grant money.? 
The Laramie lab specializes in livestock diseases caused by insects, such as 
ticks, mosquitoes and biting midges. It cooperates with other universities, 
vaccine-development corporations and the cattle industry.</content>
