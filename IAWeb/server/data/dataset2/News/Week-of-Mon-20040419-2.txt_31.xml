As part of the annual World Week for Animals in Laboratories campaign, 
activists from UCSD Students Against Animal Suffering and San Diego Animal Advocates 
protested on April 20 against animal testing conducted at UCSD. 
Protesters stood at the intersection of La Jolla Village Drive and Villa La 
Jolla Drive, passing out information and holding signs with messages such as ?
Unseen Cruelty, Suffering and Death? and ?Vivisection: Science Gone Mad.? 
?We learned of the cruel and wasteful experiments going on at UCSD and 
decided to have a protest in conjunction with World Week for Animals in Laboratories,
? Jill Fritz, president of San Diego Animal Advocates, said. 
Due to pressure from protesters, the UCSD School of Medicine decided in 
August 2003 to drop a course requirement in which students watched experiments and 
demonstrations on live dogs. 
According to Fritz, however, approximately 467 animal experiments are 
currently taking place at UCSD. 
The protesters said the school still uses primates, rodents and other animals 
to conduct research.
