KFC has dropped previously announced plans to place restaurants in
Tibet, but the decision was unrelated to a letter from the Dalai Lama
saying the "corporation's support for cruelty and mass slaughter violate
Tibetan value."
...
Michael McGraw, spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, said the organization "would be thrilled" if KFC has changed
its plan. However, "it's our understanding that they do intend to expand
into Tibet and elsewhere in Asia," he said.

In the Dalai Lama's letter, as presented by PETA, the Buddhist leader
said he decided to become a vegetarian after seeing the slaughter of a
chicken in 1965. 

"Tibetans are not, as a rule, vegetarians," he wrote, because vegetables
in the province of China are often scarce and meat forms a large part of
the diet. "However, it was considered more ethical to eat the meat of
larger animals such as yaks than small ones, because fewer large animals
would have to be killed."

Confirmation of the letter's authenticity was not immediately available.
The New York branch of the Office of Tibet, which represents the Dalai
Lama, said yesterday that verification would have to come from India,
where the main office was closed for the day.
