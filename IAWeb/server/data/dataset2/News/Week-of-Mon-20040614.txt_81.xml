A judge will soon decide whether former Puppy World owner Machelle Martin's 
animal abuse trial is moved to another county. 
Attorneys questioned a panel of 40 people Tuesday on what they knew about 
Martin's case to determine whether she could get a fair trial, in light of the 
media coverage of her case. 
Martin is charged with 33 counts of animal abuse and neglect in connection 
with Puppy World, which closed in late January after Martin's business license 
was revoked by the state. Officials said the Ingram Mill Road store had failed 
several inspections. 
Martin's public defender Brady Musgrave asked Associate Greene County Circuit 
Judge Mark Fitzsimmons to relocate the trial, citing a high probability of a 
mistrial. He observed that 95 percent of the mock jury pool questioned Tuesday 
had heard of Martin's animal abuse case in some manner.
