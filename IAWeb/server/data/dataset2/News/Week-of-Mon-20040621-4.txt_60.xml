Carson &amp; Barnes Circus says a clerical error resulted in the company
advertising its 5-year-old baby elephant, "Jennie," in stories sent to
area media in advance of its Sunday shows in Willits.

Jennie died in April.
...
The Asian elephant's death was brought to the attention of the two
newspapers when People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals protested
the circus's performance in Willits because it believes the company
should be investigated by the USDA for Jennie's death from a herpes
virus that PETA attributes to the stress of being separated from her
mother too early and being sent on the road at just 16 months of age.

PETA also alleges that "Carson &amp; Barnes recklessly commingles Asian and
African elephants -- even though African elephants carry the herpes
virus in a dormant state and can pass it across species lines to nearby
endangered Asian elephants, resulting in avoidable deaths."
