Peace River Wildlife Center staff face critical life and  death decisions  

Skip Schmidt, our exiting executive director requested this week's  column 
cover our struggles of helping all creatures great and small.  
Treating our local raccoons has been a very controversial subject  with our 
local authorities.  
Skip gave the following thoughts on the subject as the Peace River  Wildlife 
Center was presenting with three young raccoons in need of help.  
"It is never easy to hold a warm but suffering ball of feathers or  fur in 
your arms or in the palm of your hand, to imagine its pain, to picture in  your 
mind what its quality of life would be like if it survived, and to decide  
that the right thing to do is to free this beautiful creation forever from its  
bonds of misery and pain. As human beings we are taught to follow the rules --  
to stay between the lines, the lines are our friends, also to do things the  
right way. In reality, however, it is always more appropriate and important to 
 do the right thing.  
In the field of wildlife rehabilitation as in any profession there  are rules 
and regulations, protocols and procedures that are required or  recommended 
for just about every situation that you might encounter.
