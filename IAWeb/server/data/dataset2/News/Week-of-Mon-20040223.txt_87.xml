On October 20, 2003, two Gatesville city employees found a friendly kitten 
wandering in a local park and took her back to their workshop to provide 
care for her until they could find a suitable home for her. The next day, 
one of their coworkers, Butch Barton, allegedly hacked off the kitten's 
tail with his pocket knife. Unbelievably, cruelty-to-animals charges have 
not been filed against Barton!

Under Texas' anti-cruelty statute, it is a blatant violation of law to 
intentionally or knowingly torture an animal - regardless of whether the 
animal has a known owner or guardian. Gatesville's district attorney stated 
that even feral animals are protected by this statute but that it is up to 
the county attorney to prosecute this case. The county attorney is refusing 
to prosecute, claiming that he has not received any information about this 
case from law-enforcement officials. Meanwhile, Gatesville Chief of Police 
J.C. Burch has declined to forward the case to the county attorney, 
erroneously claiming that criminal charges are not merited because the 
kitten did not have an owner
PETA continues to be inundated with telephone calls from Coryell County 
residents about this disturbing case, and we are strongly urging 
authorities to pursue criminal charges against Barton for his alleged 
actions. 

Please contact the chief of police and urge him to investigate this crime 
as he would any other and to file appropriate charges. Please also contact 
the county prosecutor to ask him to vigorously prosecute Barton - for the 
sake of the community as well as its animals:

In order not to detract from our campaign, it is imperative that all 
correspondence be polite and dignified.
