Last year's 16-day, 13-county Georgia alligator season left thousands of 
hunters wishing for more gator-hunting opportunities in state waters.
This year, those hunters might get their wish.
During a series of public meetings next week, officials from the Georgia 
Department of Natural Resources will outline a proposal for dramatic expansion of 
the state's second alligator season. The proposal would make gator hunting 
legal in 27 more counties, while increasing the number of hunting permits issued 
from 180 to 300.
John Bowers, a senior wildlife biologist with Georgia DNR's Wildlife 
Resources Division, said high hunter interest is the chief reason the changes are 
being considered.
"We received over 2,000 applications for permits last year," Bowers said. "I 
don't think any of us expected that. It created a buzz all across the state."
It created a buzz outside the state as well.
"We had applicants from Alaska, Utah, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Maine -- some 
of the most amazing places," Bowers said. "It's easy for us to forget 
sometimes that not everyone has opportunities for alligator hunting like we have. If 
people from those states want to hunt gators, they have to come down South -- 
the same way people in the South have to go out West for elk hunting."</content>
