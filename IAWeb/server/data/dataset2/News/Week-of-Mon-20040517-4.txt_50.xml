Quick, does Matthew Scully sound like a Republican?

He wants increased government regulations of corporations that
mass-produce animals for slaughter. He is against "free-market" techniques
of conservation, in which some animals are killed or captured in order to
raise money to protect others. He wants the Internal Revenue Service to
investigate the Safari Club, a powerful hunting advocacy group.

Scully may sound like a liberal, but he is a conservative with impeccable
credentials: He works in the White House as a speechwriter for President Bush.

He has also emerged as a potent voice for animal welfare in what is widely
regarded as a red-meat White House. Groups fighting animal cruelty
consider him a powerful advocate, and Scully is helping to advance their
issues.

"He has had a substantial positive impact," said Wayne Pacelle, the chief
executive-designate of the Humane Society of the United States, who
credited the White House for being open to Scully's views. "I don't say
this lightly: He's a hero to animal advocates across the country."

Scully, a vegetarian for 30 years, talked about individual responsibility
when discussing a hog farm he saw in North Carolina where pigs spend
entire lives in narrow crates.
