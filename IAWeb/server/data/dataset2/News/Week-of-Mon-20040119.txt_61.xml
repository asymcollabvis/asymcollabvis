Attention Chicago dog owners! Alderman Virginia (Ginger) Rugai has introduced 
an ordinance that would prohibit residents from owning, transporting, or 
selling ?pit bulls.? Pit bulls are defined as American Pit Bull Terriers, 
Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, or any mix of those 
breeds. Violators will face fines of $100-1000 and/or up to six months in jail. 
The measure will take effect 30 days after its passage, and there is no 
grandfather clause for current owners. Countless responsible dog owners will 
therefore be forced to give up their canine companions.
The American Kennel Club strongly supports reasonable, enforceable dangerous 
dog laws designed to keep communities safe for both people and dogs. We 
believe that dog owners should be responsible for their dogs and that laws should 
impose appropriate penalties on irresponsible owners. In order to be effective, 
however, such legislation should judge a dog based on its deed rather than its 
breed.
What You Can Do:
Immediate help is needed to fight this proposal. Chicago dog owners are 
strongly urged to contact the City Council and express their opposition to the 
ordinance.</content>
