Cattleman Howard F. Lyman created chaos in 1996 when he made a case
against eating beef to a national audience on "The Oprah Winfrey Show."
He claimed the cattle industry had exposed Americans to mad cow disease
by feeding cows the remains of dead animals -- including other cows.

The flap was bigger than "Where's the beef?" Texas ranchers attempted to
corral him, Winfrey and her production company with libel lawsuits. But
Lyman won. The courts ruled in his favor, and he continues to tell his
story.

This weekend, Lyman joins a cast of prominent health professionals at
the 10th annual Health Crusade in Lodi to extol the virtues of
vegetables.

Modern Manna, a Lodi-based, nonprofit Christian ministry that promotes
the healing properties of a natural, vegetarian diet and lifestyle, and
the resultant benefits to the body, mind and spirit, sponsors the event.
More than 10,000 participants are expected to pack the Grape Festival
grounds to hear a variety of presentations and testimonies and to
observe raw-food cooking demonstrations.

Lyman's two-day presentation is called "Eating in the Garden of Eden."

"My advice is 'Don't eat anything with a face, liver or a mother,' "
said Lyman, 65, now a vegan food activist.
