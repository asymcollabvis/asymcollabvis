  <content>The Pennsylvania Game Commission board of commissioners held 
what has annually become their most important meeting of the year Sunday, ... 
... Monday and Tuesday of last week at the commission's Harrisburg 
headquarters. 
Included in the board's actions are changes to antlerless license 
applications, a proposal to allow crossbows to be used for hunting and the expansion of 
elk, bobcat and youth squirrel seasons. 
Following are the highlights of the meeting as outlined in the commission's 
recent press releases. 
To offer hunters additional deer hunting opportunities, especially in 
urbanized areas, the commissioners gave preliminary approval to a measure to further 
expand the use of crossbows for hunting in Pennsylvania. 
Under the measure, which must be approved in April before taking effect for 
the 2004-2005 seasons, crossbows could be used statewide for bear and elk and 
during any of the firearms deer seasons, including the regular two-week 
concurrent deer season, the early muzzleloader season and the late flintlock season. 
In addition, for hunters in Wildlife Management Units 2B, 5C and 5D - the most 
urbanized areas in the state - crossbows would be legal during any 
established deer season.</content>
