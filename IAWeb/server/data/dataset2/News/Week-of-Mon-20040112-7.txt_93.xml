Would you like to sit outside on a bitter cold day, with no coat and no 
house, just waiting for someone to come home and take care of you? Would you like 
to be hit? Do you want to go all day without food and water?

Neither does your dog, Monica Shaud, a cruelty investigator for the Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told Patricia Barkow's second-grade 
class at the Deerfield Township Elementary School.

"Think of all the things you would not want done to you, the way you would 
want to be treated, and do that for your animal," Shaud told the children as 
Elvis, her shepherd-collie mix, sat quietly in front of the class. "They're just 
like us. They have feelings."

The children were willing listeners, as Shaud and fellow investigator Kelly 
Serbeck told them about their job. Many had seen the "Animal Cops" program on 
Animal Planet, and already had an idea. A good part of their work is educating 
people on how to take care of pets when they see dogs on too-short chains, 
sitting outside with no water or living in a yard full of trash.

The investigators also taught the children how to interact with a strange dog 
(let it sniff you first), signs that a dog isn't friendly (ears pointed back, 
growling, showing teeth) and the importance of spaying and neutering pets 
because there aren't enough good homes for the dogs and cats already born.</content>
