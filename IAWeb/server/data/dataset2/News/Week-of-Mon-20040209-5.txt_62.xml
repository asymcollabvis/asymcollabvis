  <content>Sometimes inspiration strikes 
in the unlikeliest places. After gorging himself on Thanksgiving dinner in 
2002, Morgan Spurlock was watching TV with his belt unbuckled and his pants 
unzipped. On the news was a report about two girls in New York who were 
suing McDonald’s because, they claimed, the food made them overweight and 
sick. At one point in the report, recalls Spurlock, a representative for the 
fast-food chain claimed its food was, in fact, nutritious. It was at that 
precise moment that Spurlock, who runs his own production company, says “the 
bells went off.” He decided to make a documentary—his first feature-length 
film—in which he would, in an attempt to explore why Americans are so fat, 
eat at McDonald’s three times a day for 30 solid days.</content>
