THE THUGS who stole four puppies and other small critters from the W.B.
Saul High School of Agricultural Sciences over the weekend might have
thought they were making some kind of statement about animal rights.

But the students who loved the creatures - and had no intention of doing
any experimenting on them - are heartbroken.
...
"Go Experiment on Yourselves. We're Free - the Animals," was spray-painted
on the walls of the beagle pups' new kennel - which have heat,
air-conditioning and runs for each dog - and at the Small Animal
Technology Center nearby where rodents and other creatures are housed.
...
FBI special agent Joseph Majarowitz said the radical environmental group
Earth Liberation Front is being investigated across the country for
similar break-ins and animal thefts from research facilities and
government laboratories.

He agreed, however, that it is too early to pin this latest crime on that
cyber-savvy group.

"To them it would be that they are liberating animals," said Majarowitz,
who noted that such crimes are typically investigated as acts of domestic
terrorism.
