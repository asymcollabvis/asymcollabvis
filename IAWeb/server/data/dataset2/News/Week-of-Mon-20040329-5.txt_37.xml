  <content>Marion County officials, in adding teeth to the county's regulations 
governing dangerous dogs, are seeking to put the bite on irresponsible dog 
owners. 

The proposed measure drafted by the county's legal team includes get-tough 
regulations that redefine such canines and ways of handling them and grant more 
latitude to animal control officers. More importantly, the sweeping reforms 
reach deeper into the pockets of dog owners who run afoul of the measure.

Updating the county's violent dog policies became a priority following the 
fatal mauling in December of an 81-year-old Citra woman, Alice Broom. Broom bled 
to death in front of her home after being attacked by a pack of mixed-breed 
dogs that escaped a neighbor's mobile home. The neighbor, Robert Freeman, is 
charged with manslaughter; his dogs have been euthanized.

County commissioners will consider the new rules Tuesday. 

On Friday, County Administrator Pat Howard, who formed a task force to study 
the county's animal control ordinance and recommend changes, said it became 
apparent after Broom's slaying that the problem wasn't dangerous dogs. 

Instead, it was dangerous owners. And the county's method of dealing with 
them was impotent and cumbersome. 

"We had six dangerous dogs kill a person," Howard explained. "My intent was 
to tighten up some holes and get a little tougher. The idea is to get the 
attention of the owners." 

Most likely they will take notice of the newly suggested fines.</content>
