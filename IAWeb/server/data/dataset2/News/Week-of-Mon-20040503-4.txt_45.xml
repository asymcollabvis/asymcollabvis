Everyone talks about how much hunting and fishing mean to Colorado?s economy, 
and a recent study commissioned by the Colorado Division of Wildlife shows 
just how valuable outdoor recreation is to the state.
The report, titled ?Economic Impacts of Hunting, Fishing and Wildlife 
Watching in Colorado,? says hunting and fishing together contributed an estimated 
$1.5 billion to the state?s economy in 2002. 
This includes $800 million in direct spending along with $700 million in 
indirect or secondary spending.
Of that, fishing contributed $460 million in direct revenues, including $308 
million spent by residents and $151 million spent by out-of-state visitors.
Hunters spent $340 million, and combined, the two activities supported more 
than 22,000 jobs around the state.
?This report supports what the DOW has known for years,? said Linda 
Sikorowski of the division?s policy and regulations section, who helped oversee the 
data gathered for the research. ?Wildlife-related activities are important 
contributors to Colorado?s economy and remain among the most-popular pastimes 
statewide for residents and visitors.?
The report also said big-game hunters collectively spent more than 1.42 
million activity days (a day or any portion thereof spent hunting) afield in 2002 
while small-game hunters spent 672,000 days hunting.
