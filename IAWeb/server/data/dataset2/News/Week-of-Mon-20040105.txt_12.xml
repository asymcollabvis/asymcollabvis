If you're as alarmed as I am about Washington's mad-cow case, then you
know precisely why the disease must be stamped out without an instant's
hesitation:

To shut the gobs of insufferable vegetarians here. Especially the ones who
wear leather.

One of mad cow's most horrifying symptoms is to make these people even
more self-righteous than usual. In a just ecosystem, they would begin to
stagger after eating veggie burgers with those fake grill marks. Silly Cow
Disease. (Incidentally, I plan to have my next New York strip cut into the
shape of a zucchini.)

Take note of my bovine field research: During the WTO riots, I found
myself interviewing one of the lead protesters in their headquarters. He
seemed ill at ease, so I tried an ice-breaker. "Pez?" I said, holding out
the dispenser.

He gawked at it. "Is it vegan?"

"No, but this is," I said, and launched the ninny across the room with a
swift foot to his sunken chest. 
...
Tasty irony here. Cows are vegetarians who generally mind their own
business, and never pick an argument over whether the guy they're dating
would store his meat in their refrigerator if they were married. They get
sick when evil ranchers turn them into carnivores ? and cannibals ? by
feeding them nasty remains of cattle and other livestock. It's all very
impolite.
...
Meanwhile, McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's promptly issued statements
to reassure consumers that their beef is safe from mad cow ? and the
Hamburglar has always walked that way. Fast food will only clog your
arteries, make you balloon into Ruben Studdard and then implode your
heart. But your brain is perfectly McSafe</content>
