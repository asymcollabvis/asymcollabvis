A big part of hunting is being able to get up early and get to the woods 
while mere mortals are still sleeping. Maybe that's why the state Division of Fish 
and Wildlife is rewarding would-be hunters who fight procrastination. 
The state is giving gifts to potential hunters who sign up early for this 
year's round of hunter education field sessions and exams: The first 150 students 
to register at each of the nine testing locations will be given a cable 
trigger lock. 
These gun-safety devices were donated by Project ChildSafe, a program 
developed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation that distributes the free 
trigger locks nationally. Die-hard last-minute types, who want one of the devices 
but aren't among the first 150 to register for the hunting tests, can still get 
them from local police departments. Project ChildSafe says 190,000 locks were 
given to New Jersey police departments in November for free distribution. 
The hunting field sessions and exams are the last phase of the state's Hunter 
Home Education Study Course. They're the places where potential hunters show 
their knowledge and skill to state instructors. The program is a relatively 
new Fish and Wildlife offering designed to help fit hunting education into the 
"hectic schedules of today's fast-moving lifestyles." It uses videotapes, 
manuals and workbooks that allow prospective sportsmen to study at their own pace 
in their homes. </content>
