A pet psychic has been called into the case of Shadow, the Lincoln-area dog 
dragged behind an all-terrain vehicle and burned with cigarettes late last 
month. The dog survived and is recuperating from her injuries. 
Meanwhile, the reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in 
the animal-abuse case was raised to $10,000 Friday, with the Humane Society of 
the United States pitching in an additional $2,500 toward the steadily 
growing fund. 
"That'll buy somebody a new car," said animal lover Crystal Shear, of near 
Milton. 
Shear has followed Shadow's story in the news and contacted pet psychic Diane 
Roadcap to see whether the psychic could help. Roadcap lives in Springfield, 
Va., but also has a summer house in Lewes and has given psychic readings at 
animal-related events in the area. 
"I know some people who would say, 'Yeah, right,' " Shear said of the 
psychic. "But it's amazing the things she tells you that she couldn't have known." 
Shear said she contacted Rob Wolhar's family, who adopted Shadow from the 
Milton Animal Rescue League, to suggest they send a photo of the dog to Roadcap 
so she could work with the image to help determine who abused their pet. 
"We're curious what will come of it. It's worth a try," said Angela 
Frabizzio, Wolhar's fianc?e, who has heard from Roadcap with a message. 
"She gave us a call yesterday and said she had a feeling it was somebody 
between the ages of 14 and 17," said Frabizzio, alluding to the animal abuser. </content>
