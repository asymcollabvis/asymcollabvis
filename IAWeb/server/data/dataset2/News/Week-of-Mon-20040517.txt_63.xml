RALEIGH, N.C. - A person holding a pigeon shoot in North Carolina
would be guilty of a misdemeanor based on bills filed Tuesday at the
General Assembly. They attempt to clarify the law in the wake of a court
fight.

The state Court of Appeals ruled in February that state law is not clear
about whether pigeons are protected as domestic animals and if the state's
animal cruelty statute applied to any animals that were not domesticated.

Identical measures introduced by Rep. Bill Culpepper, D-Chowan, and Sen.
Fletcher Hartsell, R-Cabarrus, would make it a Class 1 misdemeanor if a
person "instigates, promotes, conducts" a pigeon shoot or uses property
the person owns to release pigeons for the purpose of shooting them. The
punishment is up to 120 days in jail and a fine.

The court ruling stemmed from a fight by Granville County farmer John
Malloy to hold a semiannual pigeon shoot, which typically resulted in
between 25,000 and 40,00 pigeons being shot during the four-day event.
