EDMONTON -- Howard the dolphin's relocation papers have been signed,
sealed and delivered. The permit to move West Edmonton Mall's most popular
resident to his new home, the Florida Keys Theater of the Sea, has been
given the green light by the American National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

Mall general manager Gary Hanson couldn't say when Howard would leave his
home of almost two decades, but he plans to talk to Theater of the Sea
next week to arrange the move.

Animal welfare organizations have lobbied for a new home for Howard, whose
health has declined since his companion, Mavis, died last July.
