  <content> It?s been quiet at the Johnsons? house since the babies 
left home. 
No joyful noises or petty squabbles, no clamoring for attention, no climbing 
into bed with their parents, no patter of furry little feet. 
The Bureau of Animal Control took the Johnsons? 96 cats almost two weeks ago. 
A judge ruled Wednesday that the couple, while well-intentioned, can?t 
adequately care for them. 
Their lawyer has appealed the ruling, and Animal Control is holding the cats. 
Meanwhile, Linda Johnson is beside herself. 
?I know every hair on their heads,? she said Thursday, as she wandered 
through her empty home. 
Linda and Larry Johnson married in 1977, and the cats followed soon after. 
The Johnsons were living in Timberlake when they found their first cats: a 
mother and her two kittens in their woodpile. 
Soon after, the couple began pulling cats from dumpsters and abandoned 
houses, saving them from highway medians and construction sites. 
Word spread and people began bringing them strays or dropping off unwanted 
pets when they moved. The Johnsons took them all, no questions asked. They were 
hooked. 
?A cat is a furball that encases love,? Larry Johnson said. ?You?ve got to 
learn cat language. They do speak to you.? 
The couple continued collecting cats when they moved to their Bellamy Manor 
home off Providence Road. They started holding cats for pet lovers who were 
temporarily unable to keep them. </content>
