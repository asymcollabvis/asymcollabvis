In a house on a ranch in a valley, where grizzlies, wolves 
and cougars sometimes roam, Alayne Marker and Steve Smith live in a white 
modular house that smells faintly of fine food and wet dog.
In and around it live animals, many of them crippled, blinded, abused, 
neglected or rejected by previous owners: 27 dogs, 15 cats, 16 chickens, eight pigs, 
three ewes, six cows, nine horses and one cancerous, elderly mule named 
Lonesome George.
Five years ago, Alayne and Steve bought this 160-acre patch. They planned to 
retire there in 10 years or so.</content>
