There will be plenty of horsing around this weekend at Sebastian 
Municipal Airport. 
Sarasota's Walker Bros. Circus is expected to set up its acts on the 
airport's south infield this morning for 5:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. shows today and 
Saturday, said Sebastian Vice Mayor Ray Coniglio. 
He said entertainment will include acrobats, clowns, illusionists and show 
horses. 
Officials from the nonprofit Boys and Girls Club of Indian River County have 
an agreement with the circus to provide the shows. Club officials hope to get 
about $3,000 from circus proceeds to help pay operational expenses at their 
temporary Sebastian clubhouse, 250 County Road 512. 
Coniglio chairs the Sebastian club's 12-member advisory board and had 
suggested a circus fund-raiser. 
Last month, he and other members of the City Council decided elephants and 
caged animals, such as tigers, would not be allowed to perform in the shows. 
Council members were acting on the concerns of some local animal lovers, who 
cited reported abuse of circus animals. </content>
