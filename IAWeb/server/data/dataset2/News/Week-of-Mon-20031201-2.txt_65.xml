  <content>If your menu for the December holidays always features prime
rib or filet mignon, this could be the year to cook your first goose
instead. Even opting to serve seven courses of fish, ? la the Italian
Christmas Eve tradition, might be easier on the wallet than buying beef
for a crowd.

Beef prices are soaring. At this time last year, live cattle traded at 64
cents per pound; now it's just over a dollar. And retail prices at some
stores have shot up about 40 cents per pound.

But not all price tags reflect the increase. To protect consumers from
sticker shock, some retailers are opting to absorb the extra cost, rather
than raise prices. Or they might charge more for other items to make up
the difference. Some restaurants are even steering customers toward other
entrees. McDonald's and Wendy's, for example, are hyping salads and lean
chicken pieces.

But they can't avoid raising beef prices for long, economists say.
...
Also impacting the market is the ban on Canadian beef exports into the
U.S., which went into effect in May as a result of one incident of mad-cow
disease in Alberta. Previously, about 8 percent of American beef came from
Canada.

At the same time the beef supply has been reduced, diet gurus have boosted
the appeal of red meat. Both the Atk`ins diet and the South Beach diet
tout a high-protein, low-carbohydrate approach to weight loss. So people
looking to shed a few pounds are ordering steak or a burger alongside
their salad. And they're willing to pay top dollar.</content>
