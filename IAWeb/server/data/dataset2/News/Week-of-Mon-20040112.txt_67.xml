The Animal Protection Institute (API), in conjunction with the Progressive 
Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) will again be working in Olympia to bring 
about passage of House Bill 1151, legislation that would ban the private 
possession of wild and dangerous animals, such as tigers, cougars, lions, 
bears, wolves, alligators and non-human primates. Washington is one of 
sixteen states that currently have no regulations prohibiting private 
ownership of wild exotic animals.  With all the recent news around the 
tragedy of keeping these animals as "pets," it's time to pass this bill in 
Washington!

HB 1151 has been granted a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on 
Friday, January 16, 2004 at 1:30pm in House Hearing Room B in the (John L. 
O'Brien Building).  Please try to attend the hearing!

It's important that we have a strong show of support for HB 1151.  NOW is 
the time to contact your Representatives and let them know that this bill 
needs to pass THIS YEAR!   If our elected officials do not hear from us, 
this important legislation to protect animals will fail.
