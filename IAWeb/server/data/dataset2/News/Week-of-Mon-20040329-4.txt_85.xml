PASADENA -- Marvin Rudnick was pacing around a conference table at his
upstairs office on Colorado Boulevard, working himself up into indignation.

The U.S. Attorney's Office had indicated it would be seeking DNA samples
blood or saliva from Rudnick's most high- profile client, alleged
ecoterrorist Bill Cottrell, accused of spray-painting or torching more
than 100 sport utility vehicles. After playing coy about whether and when
he could disclose his letter opposing the request, Rudnick was now making
a passionate case for its newsworthiness.
...
Cottrell, a 23-year-old physics student at Caltech and an alleged member
of the Earth Liberation Front, faces 35 years to life in prison if
convicted. At a meeting with the press after Cottrell's arraignment
Monday, Mayock did most of the talking, speaking in a smooth, honeyed
voice and comparing the crime to "aggravated vandalism.'
...
 Drawing on their years of prosecutorial service, both attorneys believe
there is political pressure to get tough on "terrorism' cases. Among nine
charges of arson and conspiracy is one of using a "destructive device'
during a federal felony. That one carries a mandatory minimum of 30 years
in prison.

That sentence, Mayock points out, is several times greater than the
sentence someone would receive for firing a gun into an occupied house.

"You can politicize cases by calling it terror when it's not, and make it
look like you're doing something for the public,' Rudnick said. "I think
the Democrats would do the same thing. But would they do it to the same
level? Would it be five years instead of 30?'

"You've got an election coming up and a president who's running as someone
who handles terrorism,' Mayock said. "There's definitely gonna be a lot of
politics in this case.'</content>
