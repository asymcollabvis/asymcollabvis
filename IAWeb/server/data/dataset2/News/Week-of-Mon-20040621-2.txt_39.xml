Lulu and Tinkerbelle, the last two elephants at the San Francisco Zoo,
will remain California girls -- they'll be moving to a sanctuary in
Calaveras County rather than packing up for Tennessee.

It's only a question of when.

"We go on elephant time now. You'd have to talk to Tinkerbelle and
Lulu," Pat Derby, who runs the Performing Animal Welfare Society's
2,300-acre refuge in San Andreas, said Wednesday.

The zoo's decision was easy: The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tenn.,
withdrew as a contender. Founder Carol Buckley was worried about Asian
elephant Tinkerbelle making a 2,292-mile trip, and the presence of
African elephant Lulu would have made life difficult for a new arrival
named Flora.
