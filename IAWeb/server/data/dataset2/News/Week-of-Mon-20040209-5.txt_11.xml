Q. My dog was recently diagnosed with Addison's disease. What is this disease 
and how is it treated?
A. Addison's disease is a condition in which the body no longer produces 
adequate amounts of certain steroids. There are several types of steroids, which 
are primarily produced in the adrenal glands. These particular steroids are 
necessary for pets to handle stress and normal body activities such as nerve 
conduction and muscle contractions. In the case of Addison's disease, the 
inadequate production of steroids results in a dog that can no longer handle the daily 
stresses in life and eventually becomes noticeably ill. Electrolyte 
imbalances primarily affecting sodium and potassium occur. These electrolytes are 
essential for normal nerve activity as well as numerous other cellular functions. 
Potassium can increase to levels that become toxic to the heart.
