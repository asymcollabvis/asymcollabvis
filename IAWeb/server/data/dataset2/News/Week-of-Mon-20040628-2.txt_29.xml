COOPER CITY ? Maddie, a 10-year-old black Labrador, had no use for the
oxygen mask placed on her nose. But it could come in handy if she ever
gets caught in a house fire.

On Wednesday, Maddie came to Fire-Rescue Station 28 on Stirling Road to
model one of the special oxygen masks recently purchased by the Broward
Sheriff's Office to give assistance to animals suffering from smoke
inhalation and other life-threatening injuries.
...
Broward Sheriff's Office bought 28 masks, which cost about $60 each,
with a grant from Animal Rights Foundation of Florida, a nonprofit
organization based in Fort Lauderdale. They come in three sizes --
small, medium and large.
