More than 30 years after the first Earth Day, which was propelled by
student energy, many of the environmental movement?s leaders and
activists are aging and graying. Is there fresh blood to carry the fight
forward? I interviewed three of MSU?s leading en-vironmental act-ivists
to find out. Sarah Clement of Marysville just graduated after studying
the environment and participating in the Bailey Scholars program. Mike
Belligan of St. Johns got his bachelor?s degree in resource development
and geography a year ago and is now pursuing a master?s in geographic
information systems. Kristin Konath of St. Clair also just graduated
with a bachelor?s degree in environmental studies and applications. Each
is determined to make an environmental difference.
...
Konath: I try to minimize my ecological impact by trying to be a
socially aware and responsible consumer, choosing a vegetarian and
mostly organic lifestyle, reducing waste by composting and buying fair
trade items.
