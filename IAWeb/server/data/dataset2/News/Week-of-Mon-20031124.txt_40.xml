Over the last week there has been considerable media coverage to the 
fact that Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott was overruling local 
democracy to give the go-ahead to the controversial primate 
laboratory proposal of Cambridge University. We at SPEAC were not 
surprised. We have always believed that the pernicious influence of 
Lord Sainsbury, our unelected Science Minister, would swing the day.

It has always been our position that the heart of the struggle would 
be by ensuring that Cambridge University realizes that building the 
lab is going to be far more bother than it is worth.  Our position is 
unchanged by last week's news. We continue to fight as before. We 
continue to take our protests to the university. We are as determined 
as ever to fight every step of the way. The various rumours and 
Cambridge University's complaint about funding all indicate that the 
impact to date has been far greater than anticipated. And the best is 
yet to come.

So, time to dig in and keep the pressure on.  We've done it many 
times before, and we will damn well do it again. On Tuesday, 25th Nov 
there is an emergence demo in Cambridge against the University to 
remind them that we are still fighting strong (12noon, outside Kings 
Parade, in Cambridge - see website for a map).  People have been 
taking it on themselves to carry out some great actions - read the 
accounts at www.primateprison.org, and why not dabble in a bit of 
re-education

For those who can not make it, there is a phone/fax/email blockade of 
the administration department on Wednesday and Thursday, so get those 
coins and email accounts ready to make our message loud and clear. 
Contact details are below. You know what needs to be done: lets send 
a loud and clear message that the UK Government be damned, there is 
no way this lab is being built.
