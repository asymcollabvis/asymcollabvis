Faith Fippinger is serving a three-month sentence at Coleman Federal
Correctional Complex for trespassing during a protest at the Fort
Benning Army base in Georgia. She is waiting to find out how she?ll be
punished for earlier violating U.S. sanctions against travel to Iraq.
...
The part of the prison where Fippinger is held is called Camp.

It has no razor wire and no clanging bars. The inmates could bolt for
Highway 470 if they got the urge.

For a woman who once lived for two years without electricity or running
water on the Alaskan tundra, the conditions aren't bad.

She gets vegetarian meals and takes a yoga class. She works in
landscaping, which is as close to gardening as she could get. She drives
a noisy lawn tractor and there, silenced by the roar, she can do her
Buddhist chants as loud as she wants.

Buddha Buddha may I become just like you.
