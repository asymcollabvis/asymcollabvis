Lynn Strachan, 21, of Ionia County, Mich. hopes to have a deer in her sights. 
Since 1970, hunting accidents have dropped dramatically due to the 
requirement of hunter safety classes for first-time license buyers.
Everyone, it seems, enjoys the sight of a white-tailed deer. It is perhaps 
one of the most beautiful of all creatures. The deer appears in more art and 
photographic work than any other wild mammal. Whether it is from a hiking trail 
or from an automobile, the sight of the whitetail is always a moving experience 
that leaves a lasting impression. 
This year, thousands will take to the woods in hopes to secure a trophy buck. 
And as in every other year there will be some who will protest the tradition. 
The fact will remain, however, that the herd is growing and this winter, 
thousands of deer will die in the competition to survive once again. It is an 
exciting time for those who hunt and a time for anger for those who do not. 
Nevertheless, state fish and game biologists have done a superb job at managing the 
herd and keeping the deer hunger and starvation level at a minimum.
