  <content>It's an hour before daylight, the sun is a violet haze on the 
horizon, and Shawn Olague is barreling down a dusty road in his truck, deep 
inside the Los Banos Wildlife Area. 
Suddenly, he kills the lights. 
"You can't let them see you coming," he says sharply. 
For Olague, a four-year veteran of the California Department of Fish and 
Game, the pre-dawn morning is a race against the clock. There are dozens of 
hunters already hidden in the grassland marsh, which stretches for miles in every 
direction and is one of the most popular areas for duck hunters each fall. 

 Olague jumps out of his truck and looks at the horizon. The sun won't be up 
for another 40 minutes, but hunters are allowed to start shooting at 
"safe-light," which on this day is 6:20 a.m. 
Wearing a brown camouflage jacket and hat, Olague rumbles down a dirt road on 
foot. At 6:08, shotgun blasts in the distance break the silence. 
Olague stops in his tracks and cranes his neck toward the blasts. 
Did they come from over that ridge? A mile away? He doesn't know. 
"Nothing you can do about that," Olague frowns. "But I'll remember it for 
tomorrow." 
On most days, being a DFG warden is a guessing game.</content>
