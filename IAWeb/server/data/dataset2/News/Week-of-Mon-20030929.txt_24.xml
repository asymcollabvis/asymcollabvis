  Scientific Advisory Committee has
approved adding a new feed alternative for inducing a molt to the industry?s
Animal Care Guidelines. Following three independent university studies, egg
farmers now have the option of using a non-feed withdrawal to induce a molt,
rather than the traditional practice of withholding feed for a short period
of time [They've always had this option as well as the option to not force
molt the birds at all]. Molting flocks results in 50 percent fewer hens
needed to meet the nation?s demand for eggs, which means significantly fewer
hens are handled, transported and slaughtered than if molting was not
induced.

The UEP Scientific Advisory Committee, which established the Animal Care
Guidelines and includes several the nation?s top scientists and academics,
met this month and agreed upon the following statement: "The Scientific
Advisory Committee says that non-feed withdrawal molt research projects have
shown promise and at this time will recommend non-feed withdrawal programs
as another option for inducing a molt. These programs should be used only if
they meet or exceed the welfare standards previously established by the
committee for feed withdrawal molts, including the standards for preparing
the flock for the molt and for maximum molt mortality and hen weight loss."

According to Dr. Jeff Armstrong, dean of the College of Agriculture and
Natural Resources at Michigan State University and chair of the Scientific
Advisory Committee: "The research on this new feed alternative has been
conducted in three university settings, but the true test will come from
field studies in the commercial egg industry. We are urging egg producers to
give the non-feed withdrawal programs a try and report their conclusions
back to us, because this is a subject we are continuing to study."
