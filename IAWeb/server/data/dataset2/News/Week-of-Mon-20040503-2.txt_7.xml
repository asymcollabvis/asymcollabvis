Despite two attacks on horses within two weeks, Stanford University 
officials said Tuesday they will not ask the state for permission to shoot 
the assailant, believed to be a mountain lion living in the foothills 
surrounding the campus.

Instead, the university has posted guards at all four entrances to the 
popular Dish trail, warning hikers and joggers about the latest incidents, 
which occurred on April 23 and May 1.

"We want to proceed with caution -- it's a safety issue,'' said Jeffrey 
Wachtel, senior assistant to the university president.

Both horses sustained deep gashes and were terrified but are recovering. The 
incidents happened within a mile and a half of the Dish trail on land the 
university leases to horse boarders and farmers.

Officials left open the possibility that something other than a cougar 
attacked the horses. While the injuries are consistent with a mountain lion 
attack, officials noted that there have been no confirmed sightings. In 
addition, the first attack occurred in the middle of the day, an unusual 
time for mountain lions to be on the prowl.

Legally, the university could get a permit from the state to shoot an animal 
that preys on livestock. Absent a request from the university, the 
California Department of Fish and Game has no plans to take action, said 
spokesman Steve Martarano.

If the animal becomes an imminent threat to public safety, law enforcement 
officers can shoot it, but Martarano said that seems unlikely.
