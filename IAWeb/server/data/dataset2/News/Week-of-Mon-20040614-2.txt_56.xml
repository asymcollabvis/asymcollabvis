When Jane Grigson wrote her definitive work on pork in 1967 and assumed
the mantle of scholar cook from Elizabeth David, it was French cuisine
she wanted to instruct us in. Just as much of David's passion about food
was dedicated to expanding British horizons by looking abroad, so
Grigson took her readers on a tour of provincial France and the guts of
its charcuterie.

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's latest book, a vast tome with the word
MEAT embossed defiantly in large, blood-red letters across its cover,
marks him out as worthy successor to that tradition of learned chef.

While admitting to great respect for vegetarians, particularly those who
refuse to eat meat as a stand against the routine cruelty and suffering
we impose on our livestock, he argues against the vegetarian position.
Historically, man has evolved eating meat as part of a mixed diet, but
he acknowledges that is not enough of a defence today. In societies
where food is plentiful, we no longer need to eat meat for health, and
in a post-Darwinian world where our biological links to the rest of the
animal kingdom are clear, animals undoubtedly come within our moral
sphere. However, he argues, any species pursuing its interests has an
impact on the rest of the planet's life. Humans inevitably affect
animals and vegetarians are no different. They upset the balance of
nature too.
