WO days of heroic efforts by whale rescuers seemed destined for a tragic end 
last night. 
The 40-foot whale pulled out to sea after becoming stranded near the La Brea 
coastline on Sunday, beached itself again yesterday. 
An all-day fight by more than 100 people ended with the exhausted animal 
being dragged two miles out to sea. 
By that time, rescuers said it was in bad shape. 
Senior Game Warden Samsundar Ramdeen said: 
"It was rolling in the current and waves and not as sprightly as yesterday 
(Monday). 
"Things look grim, but I am still crossing my fingers. I still have faith." 
Petrotrin's environmental specialist Francois Khan was less optimistic". 
"After about ten minutes (of pulling) we realised we were not getting signs 
of life from it. We realised we got no signs of life. 
Since the whale, described as a "Bryde's Whale" was found stranded, animals 
lovers have fought off people planning to butcher the animal and chasing off 
those who used knives on the whale to inscribe their names or to cut off chunks 
of blubber.
