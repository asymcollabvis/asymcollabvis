July 15 ? Would you pay more to know that your meat was raised in the
United States? Are you concerned about the conditions in which animals are
kept while they're being raised for slaughter? Do you care if your meat
has antibiotics in it or if your food contains genetically modified
ingredients?

If so, you're one of many consumers who are affecting the way food is
manufactured and labeled in the United States.

At a time when a lot of attention is being paid to issues like food
safety, mad cow disease and genetically modified foods, many companies and
the government are responding to both consumers' and activists' concerns
about the food supply.

"We'd always say give the consumer as much information as you can and he's
free to ignore it and free to make whatever decision he's going to make,"
says Art Jaeger, associate director of the Consumer Federation of America,
a Washington-based consumer advocacy group.
...
Recent moves include fast-food giant McDonald's calling on its meat
suppliers to phase out the use of growth-promoting antibiotics in its
meat, a decision that will likely change the use of antibiotics in animals
since the chain is one of the world's largest purchasers of meat.

"It's really overwhelming how much of a change there's been," says PETA
campaign coordinator Dan Shannon. "Twenty-three years ago, the idea of
free-range farming didn't exist. The idea of vegetarianism as a popular,
accepted thing didn't exist. As far as the consumer side of things goes,
it's an exploding market."
