Three animal-rights activists, including one dressed in a chicken suit,
stopped by Capitol Middle School on Thursday to provide the students a
lesson: Don't eat chickens.

But they mistimed their visit. School let out about noon, two hours
earlier than normal. Thursday was also the last day of school for the
2003-2004 school year.

So the activists from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or
PETA, had to try to persuade a handful of neighborhood children who rode
or walked by.

Activist Matt Rice said the threesome had already been to 20 states,
handing out literature to students as they left school. They were raising
awareness of the "short, miserable lives of American chickens," and the
health dangers for the children who eat them.
