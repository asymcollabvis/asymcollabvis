The gaggle of geese that crossed Prince Philip Drive in Olney yesterday
stopped traffic for only a few minutes, but the incident highlighted the
rift between animal-rights advocates and residents who say the birds
must go.

The roughly 80 geese that live around a nearby pond also are pockmarking
neighborhood sidewalks with droppings, leading the Environ community
governing board to move to kill the birds in the next two weeks. 
...
"They're playing hard nose," said Mary Moneymaker, 57, a leader in the
effort to save the geese.

She said animal-rights organizations have offered to help remove the
geese at "next to no cost," but that the board refuses to consider
options.

Shireen Ambush, the Environ Community property manager, said the board
decided to kill the geese after it received several complaints. 
...
John Hadidian, a biologist with the Humane Society of the United States,
said he is angry that residents were not informed earlier.

He also said that geese can be removed without being killed.

The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals also is defending the
geese. The group said that a few years ago a homeowners association at
Lake Barcroft in Fairfax County used a 15-point plan to remove Canada
geese without killing them.
