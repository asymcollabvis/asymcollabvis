NORMAL, Ill. McDonalds' Corp aims to have at least 10
percent of its U.S. beef purchases traceable from farm to table by
year-end in an effort to assure consumers about food safety, a company
official says.

"Our target is 10 percent by the end of the year," John Hayes, senior
director of U.S. supply for McDonalds, told Reuters in an interview
Thursday.

McDonald's (MCD: Research, Estimates) has long been a lightning rod for
meat safety issues. The latest challenge is mad cow disease, the deadly
brain-wasting ailment first reported in a U.S. animal last December,
sending shock waves through the beef industry.

More than 140 people have died in Europe from the human version of mad
cow disease, thought to have been contracted by eating infected beef.
