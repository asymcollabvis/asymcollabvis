Driving down the street the other day, I noticed yet again the struggling
little band of die-hard slogan jockeys outside the courthouse.

This told me that it must be sometime between 5 and 6 p.m. A moment later
I became depressed and supremely angry.

One should not be able to set his watch by the actions of activists. This
isn't a politically motivated crusade. It's a plea for attention and
approval from the impotent.

"Hey! Look at us, we're over here doing our part!"

If doing your part to change the world consists of informing the same
passersby day in and day out of tired, obvious truths such as war equals
oil, then we need to try another approach.
...
One of the most encouraging stories I've heard in the last few months
comes from California.

At Clippinger Chevrolet, a dealership in the Los Angeles area, a fire was
deliberately set which destroyed a significant number of SUVs as well as a
warehouse.

Slogans such as "I (heart) Pollution" and "Fat Lazy Americans" could be
seen spraypainted on some vehicles. This work has been claimed by a group
calling itself the ELF, or Earth Liberation Front.
...
As far as I can tell, no fiendish drunkards or smokers were apprehended at
the scene, and there were no shots fired. But the message is clear
nonetheless. If a rich person gets his toys broken, rest assured scores of
other rich persons will slink out of the shadows to lend a hand and ensure
the imprisonment of the evil culprits.

So what exactly qualifies these people as terrorists?

Vandals certainly, arsonists yes, but terrorists? No.
...
These people are not terrorists, they're heroes. At least they're taking
some real, effective action, which is more than can be said for the
depressingly large majority of "activists" these days.
