Rep. Goodlatte, you are not just representing the constituents in your  
district, but representing all of Americans throughout the United States when  you 
were elected into office. 
Unfortunately, your representation is lacking in ethics as well as the will  
of the American people.  
You obviously have not done your homework when it comes to horse slaughter in 
 the United States, even though there is a bill with 224 cosponsors regarding 
 this issue in your committee. You keep using the same old lines about abuse 
and  neglect will rise if horse slaughter doesn't exist, and where will all 
the  horses go, etc. 
Time and time again these pro-slaughter statements have been shot down by  
factual statistics. These statements just are not true. FYI, Rep. Goodlatte,  
please write this down in your notes regarding this issue. There are 6.9 million 
 horses in the United States. Out of these 6.9 million horses, about 10 
percent  (690,000) die each year from all causes, which includes slaughter. Last 
year  about 50,000 horses were slaughtered for human consumption. What do you 
think  happened to the 640,000 horses that were not eaten by foreigners?  
Do what is right, Mr. Goodlatte, and let HR 857, the American Horse Slaughter 
 Prevention Act, out for a vote on to the House floor and let the legislative 
 process do what it is supposed to do. Stalling bills for what seems to be a  
personal gain is not doing the right thing.
