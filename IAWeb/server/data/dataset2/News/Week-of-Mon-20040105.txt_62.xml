Meanwhile back at the corporate cattle ranch, rumors of mad cow disease
are circulating among the cattle. One group of four seem to be ruminating
upon serious matters. Let's listen while they chew the cud.

Daisy: Did you hear that poor Melvin went down and, instead of burying the
poor slob, those ranchers just shipped him off to the slaughterhouse?

Gabby: Yup, I heard talk of a few others in that condition that are on
their way to the meat market. But what happened to Melvin to make him so
sick that he couldn't even stand on his own anymore?
...
Daisy:  But why have some of us been getting sick with the BS?

Doc: That's BSE, Daisy. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. It's a
degenerative brain disease that can be transferred through the blood,
tissues, and organs. Humans get an equivalent of it, called Creutzfeldt
Jakob disease, from eating diseased meat. And there are other
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE's) in the whole food chain.
Some human doctors think there are even connections to diseases like
Alzheimer's.
...
Daisy:  Now wait, Doc. You're soundin like one of those turncoat
vegetarians. I mean what will become of us if humans won't hunger for our
meat.

Doc: Look, Daisy, it's estimated that as much as 1/4 of the land mass on
earth is devoted to cattle raising. And all of the shit and urine, pardon
my French, is contibuting to massive pollution. Why we're soiling our own
nests, so to speak. I think we've become a plague that humans invented out
of greed and protein obsession. So, we need to find some balance in all of
this.
...
For those who may want to ruminate on these matters, try reading Jeremy
Rifkin's Beyond Beef; Howard Lyman's Mad Cowboy; Sheldon Rampton and John
Stauber's Mad Cow USA; and Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation.
