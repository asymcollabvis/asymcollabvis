The importing of cat and dog fur products will be banned if Labor wins this 
year's federal election.
Opposition consumer affairs spokesman Alan Griffin said the ban was needed to 
"end the cruel and deceptive trade in dog and cat fur" and to protect 
consumers from buying falsely labeled products.
The policy, to be announced today, was welcomed by the Humane Society, which 
has campaigned for a ban and last year revealed people were unwittingly buying 
products made from cat and dog fur including clothing, ornaments and toys.
"Current laws do not prevent the importation, manufacture or sale of products 
made from dog and cat skin and fur, a practice which has rightly caused 
controversy and outrage," Mr. Griffin said.
"The ban is necessary to protect Australian consumers from fraud as the 
makers of these products attempt to deceive consumers by falsely labeling them as 
originating from fictitious animals."
Mr. Griffin said there was also evidence of health risks associated with dog 
and cat fur being used in toys, such as the carcinogen chromium, which is used 
in tanning at fur factories.
