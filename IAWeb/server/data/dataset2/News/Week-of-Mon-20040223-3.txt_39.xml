As both Vietnam and Thailand struggle to contain bird flu outbreaks and the 
death toll mounts, confusion and fear reign at the farms. Vietnamese police 
officers are not helping matters by trying to profit from the disaster, nor are 
officials by being economical with the truth.

Trucks in the compound of Charoen Pokphand's animal feed factory in a small 
town just north of Hanoi still depart on schedule, but it hasn't been business 
as usual this past week.

Uncertainty has been slowly creeping in ever since the Vietnamese government 
issued a new regulation prohibiting the transport of animal feed unless it has 
been tested and certified as disease-free. The aim is to curb the spread of 
the H5N1 strand of bird flu that has reportedly claimed the lives of at least 
14 people in Vietnam and 8 in Thailand, and caused the death of millions of 
birds across Asia. After all, it was in this area that the H5N1 virus was first 
discovered.

For the drivers leaving the compound it means taking a chance with the local 
police, who are remarkably eager to enforce the new regulations.</content>
