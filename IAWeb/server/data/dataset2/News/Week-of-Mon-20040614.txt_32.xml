As San Francisco police were arresting more than 150 people protesting
the Biotechnology Industry Organization last week, an FBI agent stood
inside the conference center, speaking to a group of scientists,
pharmaceutical reps, and biotech executives. His message: The FBI
considers ecoterrorism and animal terrorism the country's leading
domestic terror threats.

That's news to the folks who lost loved ones in the attack on the World
Trade Center buildings. So far, "ecoterrorists" like the Earth
Liberation Front and "animal terrorists" (a term that conjures up images
of lab rats with explosives strapped to their bellies) like the Animal
Liberation Front have engaged in property destruction and the disruption
of laboratory experiments, not the outright physical violence of, for
example, antiabortion extremists who've murdered doctors and clinic
staff and spit on and shoved pregnant women attempting to enter women's
health clinics.

Among most of the people I know, the general fear is not of a bunch of
animal activists freeing mink from a mink farm. It's a growing fear of
another kind of domestic terrorism: the depredations of our own
government. 
...
Meanwhile the FBI continues to target domestic dissent as its top
priority, even after John Ashcroft announced that Al Qaeda was planning
another attack on U.S. soil sometime in the near future, possibly this
summer. No one in the servile, mainstream press has pointed out the
contradiction, but those of us who feel and express a profound
discontent with our government see the overall trend: the terrorists are
not foreign; they're the people who police our streets, tap our phone
lines, monitor our spending habits, and decide who can go free and who
will be terrorized.
