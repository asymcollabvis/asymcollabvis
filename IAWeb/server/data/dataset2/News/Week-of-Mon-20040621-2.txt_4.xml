DOLGEVILLE - Two more arrests were made Tuesday in connection with what
looks like a graduation prank that went too far at Dolgeville High
School.

On the early morning of June 15, a Dolgeville village police officer
checked on the high school and found a number of dead animals about the
grounds. A decaying deer carcass had been dumped in front of the
school's main entrance and two freshly killed cats hung from the high
school marquee and a "Do Not Enter" sign on the property. A second deer
carcass hung from a school fence. Eggs had been thrown at the school and
fish organs along with a dead frog were found on the marquee. There was
vulgar language directed at a faculty member spray painted on the
sidewalk.
 
It appears the act of vandalism was a graduation prank that got out of
hand.

Under 1999's "Buster's Law," also known as the Felony Animal Cruelty
Act, aggravated cruelty to domestic animals, such as killing two cats
and hanging them on display, is a felony offense punishable by up to two
years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
