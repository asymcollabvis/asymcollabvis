  <content>MicroIslet, Inc. (Amex: MII)
today announced a collaboration with the University of California, Davis
(UC Davis) in the area of islet cell transplantation therapies for treatment
of insulin-dependent diabetes.  Under the terms of the agreement, MicroIslet
and the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis plan to
conduct non-human primate studies utilizing MicroIslet's proprietary
technologies for preparation and encapsulation of pig islets.  MicroIslet
believes the completion of the studies at UC Davis will set the stage for an
Investigational New Drug application (IND) and that the data from these
studies will be included as part of the IND for human clinical trials.  The
project at UC Davis will be conducted in parallel with MicroIslet's ongoing
collaboration with Dr. Daniel Salomon of The Scripps Research Institute in La
Jolla, California.
