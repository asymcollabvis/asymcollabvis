Dolphins at Bruges : dead or alive !
 
Please help us to ask Mr Jeff Tavernier to close the Bruges' Dolphinarium 
 
sample letter  to minister J. Tavernier  
E-mail: jef.tavernier@minsoc.fed.be 
 
Mr Tavernier,

We ask you to close Bruges? dolphinarium for the following reasons:
Even if dolphins are surviving longer in Bruges than in other places, it changes nothing to the fact it's not a right place for them. To be able to survive so long is just a sign of their huge intelligence, adaptability and love of life.
On the other hand, breeding-in-tank kills a lot of newborn each year and gives birth to some kind of dolphin-zombies. Without culture, without complete social relationships, without sun and fresh air, without seeds, rocks and real salt water, a dolphin is not a dolphin.
He is not able to learn how to hunt in the sea, nor how to speak his own tribe's dialect nor how it feels to swim straight on during hours and hours under the sky in an open sea....
Bruges? dolphinarium is just an animal circus, devoted to "intensive breeding" and solding their dolphins as soon as they're weaned, as totally dominated and tractable "dolphin slaves", performing days after day, weeks after weeks, years after years, until they die too young... 
Millions of European animal lovers will be grateful that this business will be halted in Europe.
Yours Sincerely,
