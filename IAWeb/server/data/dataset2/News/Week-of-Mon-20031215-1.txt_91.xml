Please copy this letter and send to 
the CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES (CITES)
concerning MR. Abu Hassan  aka  Professor Assan and his Amazing Animals 
E-mail: CITESENFORCEMENT@cites.org
 
DEAR CITES - 

Please stop the animal mistreatment and smuggling activities of 
Abu Hassan, doing business as Professor Assan and his Amazing Animals
in Africa.

Conditions at this circus are appalling.  Animals are locked in 
cages too small for them.  They trap also wild animals and sell them 
to overseas buyers.  They smuggle chimps and parrots. THIS HAPPENS
EVERYWHERE THEY PERFORM!!!


Yours Sincerely,
