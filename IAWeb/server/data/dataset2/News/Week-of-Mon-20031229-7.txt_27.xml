The Corsicana Animal Shelter has gone high-tech, giving homeless pets a 
better chance of finding a loving family.
Shelter supervisor Kristie Franks said the Petfinder Web site has done 
wonders for the adoption rate, especially during the holiday season. Corsicana's 
area of the site can be viewed at www.petfinder.com/shelters/TX533.html.
The results have been far-reaching, enabling one Keeshond to find a home in 
Pennsylvania, although most homeless pets from Navarro County are more likely 
to find new owners in cities like Houston, Dallas, Waco and Tyler.
"We have the software, so all we have to do is take a picture of the animal 
and post it on the Web page," Franks said, adding that city council approved 
the purchase of a digital camera for the shelter this year.
Some breeds, like the Keeshond, are sought after by rescue groups whose 
members are always on the lookout for adoptable animals. Other animal welfare 
groups provide foster homes for specific breeds until permanent homes can be found. 
For this reason, the Petfinder Web site is an especially valuable tool.</content>
