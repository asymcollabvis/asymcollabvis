  Two black bears that were seized in a marijuana arrest at 
the Canadian border are bound for a wildlife sanctuary in Texas. 
Corky and Pumpkin are set to leave the Sarvey Wildlife Center on Wednesday to 
join more than 600 creatures at the nonprofit Wild Animal Orphanage in San 
Antonio, officials at Sarvey said. 
"When we walk back to the pens after they're gone, it will be like our best 
friends left. We'll miss them," Sarvey volunteer Jeff Guidry said. "Everybody 
loves these bears." 
The 7-year-old sows were sent to the wildlife center near this Snohomish 
County town after U.S. Customs agents found 166 pounds of marijuana worth nearly 
$500,000 in a trailer carrying the bears at the border crossing in Blaine on 
Jan. 27. 
Duane Christopher Bradley of Abbotsford, British Columbia, pleaded guilty in 
July to conspiracy to distribute marijuana and was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in 
prison. 
He initially told investigators he was taking the bears to Hollywood for a 
movie, than said he was taking the pot to Los Angeles to exchange for cash and 
cocaine to take back to Canada, according to documents filed in U.S. District 
Court.
