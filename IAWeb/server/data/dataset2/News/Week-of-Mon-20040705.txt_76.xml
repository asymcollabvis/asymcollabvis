PENN YAN ? In the wake of the recent torture and killing of a cat that
had made its home at Morgan?s Grocery, the Humane Society of Yates
County plans to host an animal abuse forum this week.

Local law enforcement and Humane Society staff will be at the event, at
7:30 p.m. Thursday at the First Baptist Church, to provide the public
with information about preventing animal abuse.

Humane Society President Rolf Zerges said a panel will answer questions
about what legally constitutes animal abuse; how to report and prevent
it; and where recent cases stand.

The Humane Society held a similar event in October 2002.

Yates County sheriff?s deputies charged James McElwee, 22, of 2306 Old
Route 14A, Penn Yan, and Steven Rector, 17, of 3416 Willet Road, Keuka
Park, with felony aggravated cruelty to animals June 28. They are
accused of taking the cat from Morgan?s Grocery on or around May 30 and
torturing and shooting it at a gravel pit on David Downey Road in
Torrey. Investigators say the pair then buried the cat in a shallow
grave. 
...
PETA officials urged that, after conviction and jail time, McElwee and
Rector be required to undergo thorough psychological evaluations
followed by mandatory counseling and anger management classes at their
expense.
