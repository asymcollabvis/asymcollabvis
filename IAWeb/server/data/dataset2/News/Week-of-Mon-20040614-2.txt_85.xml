FORESTRY companies have shot nearly 50,000 wallabies and possums to protect 
forests and plantations over the past two years, Department of Primary 
Industries documents show.

Shooters employed by Gunns Ltd and Forestry Tasmania shot 15,225 brushtail 
possums and 30,226 Bennetts and red wallabies in the period between January 2002 
and April 30 this year. 
The figures from the Nature Conservation Branch were obtained by The Mercury 
under the Freedom of Information Act. 
Sixteen fallow deer were also shot during the same period. 
Eighty per cent of the animals were shot on behalf of Gunns Ltd on 250,000ha 
of forest and plantation across the state. 
Most animals were killed with shotguns and spotlight, with live trapping and 
shooting also widespread. 
Wilderness Society campaign co-ordinator Geoff Law said the figures 
demonstrated one of the massive impacts of industrial forestry. 
"This shows that a vast number of animals, which are otherwise protected, are 
being killed," he said. 
Mr Law said the figures were a "reality check" and an indication that 
probably more than 500,000 animals were killed by 1080. 
Increased shooting has resulted because the State Government wants 1080 usage 
reduced.
