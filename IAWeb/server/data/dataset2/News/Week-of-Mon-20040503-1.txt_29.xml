 Distraught family members flew to the exclusive Lion Sands Lodge in 
Mpumalanga on Wednesday after an elephant trampled senior ecologist Kay 
Hiscocks to death on Tuesday. 
Hiscocks' father flew into the Sabi Sands reserve from Durban on Wednesday 
morning to visit the scene of his 42-year-old daughter's death. 
Hiscocks, the only full-time ecologist on the 65 000-hectare Sabi Sands, was 
killed when an adult elephant cow cornered and trampled her 40 metres from the 
world-famous lodge. Hiscocks, who held a certificate in 'dangerous game 
theory', was reportedly trying to herd the cow and two bull elephants away from the 
lodge at the time. 
"Kay was an impeccable professional, whose passion shone through everything 
she did here over the past 10 years. This tragic incident was an unavoidable 
accident, but Kay died doing what she loved most," said Lion Sands' shocked 
co-owner, Nicholas More, on Wednesday. 
More stressed that Sabi Sands warden Gavin Hulett was conducting a full 
investigation into the incident, but had already described the death as an 
"unavoidable and extremely unfortunate accident". 
The elephant cow, which only turned on Hiscocks after allowing itself to be 
herded almost 30 metres, was wounded three times by Lion Sands ranger Izak de 
Villiers shortly after the attack when shocked staff tried to drive the angry 
animal off. 
"[Hulett] was immediately informed, and after establishing that the elephant 
posed a risk to guests and staff ... it was destroyed," said More.
