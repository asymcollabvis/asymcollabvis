  <content>The subject of cats again made Akron City Council's Health 
and Social Service Committee agenda at its Feb. 23 meeting as council looks 
for ways to satisfy the continuing debate of what to do about stray cats. 
Testifying at a 1:30 p.m. committee meeting, chaired by Councilwoman Rene? 
Greene (D-4), were members of Citizens for Humane Animal Practices (CHAP); Jeff 
Fusco, Akron's deputy service director; Richard Farkas, executive director for 
the Humane Society of Greater Akron; and several other concerned citizens. 
According to Greene, the legislation under consideration "offers incentives 
to encourage responsible pet owners to spay and neuter their pets, including 
cats and dogs."


The proposed legislation would provide low-cost spay and neuter clinics as 
well as low-cost microchip implants to low-income pet owners. Provisions of 
previous legislation that allow for trapping stray cats and requiring pet owners 
to keep all their pets on their own property will not change. Those latter 
provisions have caused the most rancorous debate because most captured stray cats 
are euthanized after three days. 
CHAP has always maintained that the most effective way to control stray cats 
is through a spay and neuter and release program. It has worried members that 
personal pets could be captured and euthanized before the owner could retrieve 
them from the animal shelter. But this committee meeting remained calm, 
despite CHAP not agreeing with the proposal.
