Paul Watson is as close as you can get to a 21st-century pirate of the
high seas.

As the self-proclaimed "captain" and founder of Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society, he has rammed ships, sunk them and been jailed by foreign
nations, all in the name of saving the lives of marine animals. Watson is
now trying to take over the national Sierra Club to further his cause.

He makes no apologies. He claims that the 10 ships his group sank between
1979 and 1998 were illegally hunting for whales. 
...
"The best way to understand Sea Shepherd is to view it as a more radical
Greenpeace," said Rik Scarce, author of the book "Eco-Warriors:
Understanding the Radical Environmental Movement."
...
The Center for Consumer Freedom, a group that promotes food choices,
supported by such restaurants and food companies as Philip Morris, notes
that notorious animal-rights activists, such as the Animal Liberation
Front's Rodney Coronado, got their start with Sea Shepherd. Coronado was
convicted of setting fire to an animal research laboratory.

For his part, Watson, 53, sees himself as a savior of the seas, not an
eco-terrorist.

And he insists he doesn't support the use of violence, at least according
to his own definition of the word. To Watson, violence constitutes
deliberate harm to a living being, not harm to property. 
...
So some Sierra Club members plan to be there Sunday, when Watson speaks at
the "high-tea" fund-raiser at a private home in La Jolla. Actors Richard
Dean Anderson and Linda Blair are among the Sea Shepherd supporters
expected to attend, said Lambert, the organizer.
