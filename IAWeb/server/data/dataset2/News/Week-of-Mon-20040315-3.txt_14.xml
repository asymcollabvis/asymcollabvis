Of those questioned in the recent survey, 50 percent stated they would 
"definitely or probably purchase" eggs carrying the logo. An additional 34 percent 
stated they would "possibly or maybe purchase" such eggs. 
Price was not a major factor to most of those surveyed. Nearly one-third (32 
percent) of those surveyed stated they would be willing to spend 5 percent 
more for Animal Care Certified eggs if the cost was higher. Twenty-two percent 
reported willingness to spend 10 percent more.

United Egg Producers, said in a statement. "The Animal Care Certified
