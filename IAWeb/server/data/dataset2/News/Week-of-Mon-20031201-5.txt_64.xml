  <content>With salon appointments booked weeks in advance, everyone wants to be turned 
out for the holidays. A wash and blow- dry, a color and cut, a nail trim and 
maybe some poinsettia-red polish. 
Nothing's more relaxing than a nice flea dip and a spritz of "Bono Sport" or 
a full-body brushing and a dab of "Beautifur." Grooming, at the hands of a 
professional, is appreciated by canine clientele as much as it is by doting 
owners. 
While Mickey, a miniature poodle, wouldn't comment after his teal-blue dye 
job, he was in no hurry to escape Kathy Kellman's gentle handling. The Barking 
Lot groomer combed out every strand of his baby-fine fur. She neatly 
scissor-snipped from ruff to tail and transformed him from dandelion puff to soft-spun 
cotton candy. 
It's a dog's life, for sure. But grooming is serious business. Bathing and 
brushing, along with ear cleaning, teeth washing and nail clipping, keeps pets 
in top shape. Grooming improves an animal's touchability, minimizes shedding, 
reduces allergens and alerts pet owners to health problems in their earliest 
stages. </content>
