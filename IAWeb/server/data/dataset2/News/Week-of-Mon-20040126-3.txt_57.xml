Heavy snowstorms could be a blessing to plants in southeast Wyoming, but a 
curse to wildlife. 
A harsh winter could increase mortality rates among big game that rely on fat 
reserves to survive cold weather. 
?One or two more storms could make the difference between having huge to 
normal mortality,? said Bob Lanka, a wildlife management coordinator with the 
Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
With less vegetation available over the years due to drought, some animals 
are getting by on low fat reserves. As a result, the availability of shrubs and 
grass takes a greater importance for deer, antelope and elk. 
Lanka said most mule deer examined at check stations last fall were in fair 
health. 
?Some looked good, some looked really bad,? he said. ?Overall, it wasn?t 
what we would like to see.? 
Big game animals typically eat shrubs during the winter, which isn?t a 
nutritious diet, even in the best circumstances. During that time, they use fat 
reserves to compensate for vitamin deficiencies.</content>
