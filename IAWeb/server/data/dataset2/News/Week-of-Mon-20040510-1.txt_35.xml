  <content>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has
ordered its inspectors in Texas not to talk about mad cow disease with
outside parties.

United Press International has learned that the gag order was sent May 6
by e-mail from the USDA's Dallas district office. It was issued in the
wake of the April 27 case at Lone Star Beef in San Angelo, in which a cow
displaying signs of a brain disorder was not tested for mad cow disease
despite a federal policy to screen all such animals for the deadly
disease, otherwise known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
