TAYLOR -- Ralph Caputo always tried to instill respect for animals in
his children.

Now, he has the respect of an international animal rights organization.

Mr. Caputo's daughter, Cassandra, 8, wrote an essay about her dad and is
one of five winners in the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals'
"World's Kindest Dad" essay contest.

Cassandra's mother, Lisa Caputo, said she noticed the contest on PETA2's
Web site. She helped her daughter, a student at St. Mary's School, Old
Forge, send out the essay online.
