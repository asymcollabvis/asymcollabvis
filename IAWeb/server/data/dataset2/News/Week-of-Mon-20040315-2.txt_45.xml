  <content>State officials are working to vaccinate Florida panthers 
for feline leukemia, a deadly virus that has killed at least two panthers in the 
past few years.
A total of four panthers have been diagnosed with the disease since 2002. Two 
died from infection, one died after a fight with another panther, and another 
is still roaming the Okaloacoochee Slough.
Two capture teams with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 
and the National Park Service are mounting a joint effort to stop the 
slow-moving, but deadly, virus in its tracks, vaccinating 16 panthers against the 
disease so far.
''It's hard to say what could happen because it's not happened before,'' said 
Mark Cunningham, wildlife veterinarian for the Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission. ``We're kind of taking it seriously and jumping on the 
problem early on.''
The virus can be passed during mating or during a fight or from mother to 
kitten.
SEEKING SOURCE
Researchers are trying to track down the source of the disease, but the 
suspicion is that it came from a panther run-in with domestic cats or feral cats, 
said National Park Service veterinarian Emmett Blankenship.
Some panther advocates support transplanting panthers to other parts of 
Florida to give them more room to roam.
Capture teams are focusing their vaccination campaign in Collier County, the 
southern part of the panthers' range, to try to keep the disease from 
spreading. So far, they have found no other cases, Cunningham said.</content>
