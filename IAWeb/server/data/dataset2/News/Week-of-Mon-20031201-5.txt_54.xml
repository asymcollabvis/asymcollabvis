  <content>The black cat with a white stomach and paws curled up in Rapp's arms and 
purred. 
Rapp, who takes care of the feline area of the Clark County Humane Society's 
animal shelter, held out her hand and asked for a high-five. 
Rascal pawed her back. 
Rapp has three dogs and two cats at home, but Rascal is her pride at work. 
On Saturday, she was pleased with the number of adoptions that had occurred 
thus far that day, but she knew Rascal still didn't have a family. 
The animal shelter held a "Meet Our Mutts" adoption day, with adoption rates 
cut from $75 to $58.50 for dogs and from $35 to $20 for cats. 
Although Pam Campbell, the shelter's adoption coordinator, had hoped for more 
than the seven adoptions, she was pleased with the results. 
"We had two boxers that grew up together that were adopted together," 
Campbell said. "We didn't think that would happen." </content>
