  <content>f you live in Eastern PA, New York, or New Jersey get ready to go ten ro=
unds against vivisection. The SHAC campaign across the North East has bee=
n heating up as the temperature has been dropping. Protests, educational =
stalls, and home demonstrations have been plaguing HLS animal abusers eve=
rywhere and with great success. Over the next couple weeks, as you are on=
 a break from school or trying to use up your remaining vacation days bef=
ore the year is up, help the animals suffering inside of Huntingdon by ta=
king part in many, if not all of, the following events:

Round One:
WHEN: December 4th, 2003; 9AM =96 10:30AM
WHERE: US District Court House / US Post Office, Federal Square, Newark, =
NJ
WHAT: SHAC Protest Against the un-American Grand Jury silencing political=
 activists.
WHY:  In the spring of 2003 19 rather intrusive FBI agents put their grub=
by little hands all over the belongings of 3 SHAC organizers in a raid on=
 their home. The raid was carried out in the name of a secretive Grand Ju=
ry investigating animal rights protests. Several people from across the c=
ountry have been subpoenaed to this grand jury where they are stripped of=
 all their constitutional rights, are allowed no attorney, and if they fa=
il to answer one question can be sent to jail until they will talk. The G=
rand Jury can, and has, asked any sort of question no matter how personal=
 or private. Grand Juries are famous for their use against political figu=
res (Martin Luther King and his family are famous targets of such repress=
ion.) SHAC will not take such a constitutional assault lying down and is =
exposing these Orwellian Grand Juries for what they are =96 PERVERTED! Si=
gns, banners, and leaflets will be brought to the protest by SHAC.
