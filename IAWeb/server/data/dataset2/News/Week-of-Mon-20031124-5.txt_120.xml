Being more interested in consuming chard than counting chads, vegetarians
did not play a prominent role in the last presidential election. Unless
something changes quickly, history seems destined to repeat in Campaign '04.

Though vegans now have one of their own as a candidate, Democratic U.S.
Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, there is scant evidence they are rallying
behind him.

Perhaps the reason is they are unaccustomed to having a vegetarian aspire
to the White House. "I haven't carefully researched it, but I'm pretty
sure the congressman would be the first vegan president," Kucinich
spokesman David Swanson said.

Americans don't seem to want a president who spends much time perusing the
parsley in the produce aisle. Our nation historically has preferred
carnivores for their commanders in chief.

"Many vegetarian organizations, including ours, are nonprofit, tax-exempt
organizations that have to work within the confines of not supporting
political candidates," explained Brian Graf of the North American
Vegetarian Society in Dolgeville, N.Y.

Vegetarian groups have been politically inert since the dawn of time, but
they need to quickly become a force if Kucinich is to have a chance. They
should funnel money to a quasi-independent political action committee,
drum up some donations and create a slick new slogan to publicize their
political prowess.

"You Can't Beet Vegan Voters," maybe? </content>
