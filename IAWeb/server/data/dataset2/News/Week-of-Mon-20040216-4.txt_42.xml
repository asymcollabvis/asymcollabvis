  <content>Dull days are over for badger and bobcat alike at Living Desert 
Zoo and Gardens State Park.

On Sunday, toys will be placed in the exhibits of many of the zoo?s animals, 
thanks to the Carlsbad Foundation?s Barbara Meyer Living Desert fund.

And the public is invited to see their reactions at a ?Boomer Ball Bonanza.?

Starting at noon, seven different exhibit areas will be visited every 
half-hour, with Boomer Balls, ?logs? and spools left for the animals to discover.

Holly Payne, the park?s wildlife culturist supervisor, said the park selected 
animals that would benefit the most from the items the park could order. 

The animals include javelinas, bobcats and mountain lions, and a black bear, 
porcupine, badger, gray fox, ringtail and coachwhip snake. 

?Some were chosen because we thought we?d get a good reaction, so the public 
can learn more about what we?re doing and how important this is,? Payne 
said, adding, ?We don?t guarantee that people will see a reaction.?

Payne said some animals will probably go right up to the toys, especially if 
food is placed inside. But it will likely take a little time for others to 
investigate.

?This is the first time some will have seen any item like this,? she said.

About 20 toys were purchased with $400 from the Foundation fund. They vary in 
size from just a few inches to 2 feet long. 

The toys are made of high-density plastic, so they are very durable, Payne 
said, and they can be exchanged, so new items enter an animal?s enclosure.
