MARIO is a full-figured man, but notice how his ensemble provides a
slimming effect. He is wearing a puffy black jacket, baggy jeans and a
pair of Air Force 1 sneakers that he bought in Brooklyn for $85. What
draws the eye, though, is his Cleveland Cavaliers jersey, a LeBron James
model.
...
And here are five, no seven, no nine - here are at least 13 officers of
the New York Police Department. They are wearing blue pants, blue caps and
blue duty jackets, possibly purchased from the equipment room at 1 Police
Plaza. From their black belts hang loops of plastic handcuffs.

One of them also wears three blue chevrons high on his sleeve, creating a
"sergeant" effect. He is conferring with a burly fashion show employee
whose black suit is offset by a tag featuring the word "security" and a
picture of a stiletto-heeled shoe. Next on the Sixth Avenue runway, it
seems, is PETA, the animal rights group.

In the past, PETA routinely disrupted fashion shows that featured the
works of designers they called "fur pimps." A couple of years ago, though,
the group reached an understanding with the organizers of Fashion Week
that allowed the activists to deliver their anti-fur message while the
fashion world was in town.

Here comes Michael, a PETA spokesman, in a long gray coat made of cotton,
acrylic and polyester. He greets the security man in black, and ground
rules for a 15-minute demonstration are finalized. A section of the steps
leading to the tent are roped off.</content>
