 FELINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY, CAT - SWITZERLAND
 ************************************************** 
 Mad cat disease
 - ----------------
 A 2nd case of feline spongiform encephalopathy
 (FSE), a disease 
 affecting the brain tissue of cats, has been
 recorded in Switzerland.
 
 The veterinary authorities said the likely cause of
 the infection, which is 
 similar to mad cow disease, was contaminated pet
 food. A 1st case of FSE was 
 reported 2 years ago. Experts say the disease poses
 no health risk for people
 ; 
 [When the identification of FSE was initially
 published by the Bristol 
 Veterinary School in 1990, this was the 1st
 indication that BSE is 
 capable of crossing the species barrier and sparked
 fears that it might 
 affect humans as well. This was confirmed 6 years
 later.
 
 According to DEFRA's BSE-site's update of 30 Jun
 2003, 89 FSE cases have 
 been diagnosed in the UK so far, including 20 since
 1996 (the last one in 
 2001).  Of these 20 cases, 8 could be clearly
 identified as having been 
 born after September 1990 (i.e., the date the ban on
 the use of SBO was 
 extended to any animal feed). 5 additional cases
 have been reported outside 
 the UK, namely N. Ireland, Norway, Liechtenstein
 (one case each), and 
 Switzerland (2 cases, including the current one).
 
 In addition, 21 cases of TSE regarded to be FSE have
 been reported in 
 exotic felids in zoos, their age ranging between 6
 and 17 years. Of those, 
 16 have been recorded in the UK (5 cheetahs, 2
 lions, 3 ocelots, 3 pumas, 
 &amp; 3 tigers). 5 additional cases, in cheetahs, have
 reportedly been 
 identified outside the UK: 1 in Australia (1991; the
 very 1st case 
 diagnosed in a cheetah), 1 in Ireland, &amp; 3 in
 France. 4 of these cases 
 are known to have originated in the UK, while one
 was diagnosed in a 
 cheetah born in France. See under "other TSEs" in
 &lt;http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/bse/index.html.
 
 A presumptive FSE case in an imported Asian Golden
 Cat in an Australian zoo 
 was reported in August 2002.
 
 Data on the age of the current, 2nd FSE case in
 Switzerland and on the 
 suspected petfood will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
