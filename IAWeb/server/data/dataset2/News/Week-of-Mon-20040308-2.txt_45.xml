  <content>While the sky turned from nighttime black to 
pre-dawn blue and the wind cut through the pines and palmettos, the hunters 
unloaded their gear and the hounds paced in the covered bed of a pickup.
By the time the eastern clouds began to turn pink, the horses were saddled 
and the hunters were primping their tweeds and adjusting their Windsor knots. A 
radio played Irish fiddle music.
Far from the music, Loxahatchee, Fla., resident Maria Wise Miller rode across 
the pine flat woods alone. A length of string - its end soaked in fox urine - 
dragged behind her horse, laying a trail for the hounds and hunters to follow.
At 7:15 a.m., the master of the foxhounds blew his horn, the 18 riders 
gathered and the dogs poured out of the back of the truck, claws clicking on the 
metal tailgate, noses searching for the fox's scent.
The hunt was on.
Foxhunts, like this one hosted by the Palm Beach Hounds, are becoming 
increasingly popular in the United States and Canada, according to Dennis Foster, 
director of the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America.
Over the past decade, the number of foxhunting clubs in the two countries has 
increased by more than 25 percent - from 140 to 177, he said.
Though foxhunting long has been under fire from animal rights activists in 
the United Kingdom, it has attracted much less attention in the United States. 
American hunters say their version of the sport is focused on the chase and 
doesn't usually involve killing foxes.</content>
