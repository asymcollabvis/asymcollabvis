BACK in January I decided to go raw.

No more heat for me, no siree.

I'd eat veggies, I'd eat fruit, I'd eat...nut butter.

For one month, I would not consume anything that had been heated above 118
degrees. Or was that 116 degrees? Hmmm, I'd have to check on that.

Why was I doing this?

Well, I'd like to tell you I have an unending dedication to my profession,
but it was actually curiosity, pure and simple, that got me to eat four
consecutive meals of sprouted quinoa.

Inspired by the promises of improved health, vitality and energy by raw
food visionaries, I was determined to find gastronomic enlightenment
without engaging in the oh-so passe practice of cooking.

Instead of steaming, I'd sprout. Instead of baking, I'd blend. Instead of
noshing on hot, cheesy pizza, I'd whip up a batch of Thai Green Papaya
Salad or Raw Borscht.

To tell you the truth, I was a little nervous.

I'm not a vegan. I'm not even a vegetarian. I would have to transition
from being a meat-eating, heat-using omnivore to having an entirely vegan,
frying pan-free existence.
