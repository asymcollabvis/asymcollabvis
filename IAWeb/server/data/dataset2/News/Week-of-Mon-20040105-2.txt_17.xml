Thirteen mixed-breed pit bulls, including six young puppies, are 
scheduled to be euthanized next week in the wake of the Dec. 12 mauling death of 
81-year-old Citra resident Alice Broom.

Marion County Code Enforcement officials said Monday the owner of the dogs, 
Robert Freeman, 67, has until Jan. 14 to request a hearing in hopes of saving 
the dogs. If Freeman doesn't respond, the dogs will be killed the following 
morning.</content>
