A Flintville man faces animal cruelty charges stemming from the alleged 
starvation of a dog chained to a van, while another man has been sentenced to nine 
months in a separate animal starvation case. 
Dennis Ray Price, 34, of Brighton Road, admitted to being the owner of an 
emaciated male boxer that died on Dr. Mike Farrar's examining table just moments 
after animal shelter workers rushed the animal to the veterinarian for care 
late Tuesday afternoon.

"It had been laying on the ground unconscious, barely breathing, foaming at 
the mouth and was covered with mange," said Martha Richards, Humane Society 
member and Fayetteville Animal Shelter worker.

"We put him in the front seat and turned the heat on high - He was so cold," 
said Richards.

Moments after they arrived at Farrar's office, the dog's heart began beating 
erratically, and he died, officials said.

"It had been a long time since he had eaten, at least one to two months to 
lose that much body fat," said Farrar. 

The dog weighed less than 34 pounds, about half of what he should have 
weighed based on the size of his skeleton, the veterinarian said. With no food to 
produce body heat, no doghouse, a sparse coat due to the mange and heavy load of 
internal parasites, the dog had no defense against the cold. 

An anonymous tip had led shelter workers to the dog, but it was a day or two 
late. 

"If citizens would call before it's too late ... it's the only way the Humane 
Society can rescue the animals," Richards explained.
