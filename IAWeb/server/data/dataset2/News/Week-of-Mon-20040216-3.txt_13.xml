  <content> People will be able to adopt dogs that were rescued from a 
trailer that belonged to the co-owners of a closed pet store.   After a hearing 
on Wednesday morning, Greene County Associate Circuit Judge Mark Powell gave 
official custody of 11 dogs to the Southwest Missouri Humane Society, clearing 
the way for their adoptions. 
   The Humane Society is getting ready for hundreds of applications from 
people eager to adopt the formerly neglected dogs.  The dogs won't be available 
for a few days because the Humane Society set up a special system to make sure 
they all get good homes.  It?s different than the Humane Society?s usual 
adoption process.
   County and state workers took 14 dogs from a trailer home north of 
Strafford on Feb. 2.  Most of them are adults and likely were not for sale at Puppy 
World, which used to be on Ingram Mill Road just north of Sunshine Street.  
Machelle and John Martin owned Puppy World until state officials ruled the 
Martins didn?t provide adequate care for puppies at the store and revoked Puppy World
?s license to sell dogs on Jan. 28.  Officials found few, if any, of the 
puppies that were for sale at Puppy World.  They hope the Martins returned them to 
their breeders.  The dogs at the trailer may have been used for breeding. 
   The Martins each face 14 charges of animal abuse in Greene County because 
of the dogs found at the home.  Animal Control workers say the dogs were 
living with piles of feces and had no food and water.  Eleven were inside the 
trailer.  The day after the rescue, one was returned to its rightful owner.  Humane 
Society officials say another is potentially too dangerous to be put up for 
adoption now and a third is too badly injured or sick to be adopted now.  Both 
may be available for adoption later. </content>
