WAUCHULA, Fla. - (KRT) - Out in the woods, the new morning ambles
through the oaks and pines, fluttering sunlight over the creek,
pestering jaybirds into raucous gargle and wooing the creature from his
dreams with fresh fruit, herbal tea and the old, sweet promise: You are
safe here.
...
This center, with its spacious habitats and almost 2,000 feet of
elevated chutes, which extend the animals' range and choice, is one of
nine nonprofit great-ape sanctuaries in North America and the only one
dedicated to orangutans. It is not a breeding facility. It is not a zoo.
Although scientists, animal-care experts, students and supporters often
visit, it is not open to the public, and when a convertible full of
smiling, sunburned tourists pulls into the driveway, Ragan apologizes
but firmly turns the sightseers away.
