Move over, Michael Jackson!  A new White Tufted-Ear 
Marmoset is in Town

You may know him as the singing superstar from the 
Hip Hop music scene, but those close to r'Bear say 
his time is now spent running a captive breeding program 
in Southern California to repopulate endangered species.

It's like, you take a Spix's Macaw and put him in 
the right tree with a Lady Spix's Macaw, and, like, the 
next thing you know, you got babies, said r'Bear, who 
invited us on a tour of Shraavana, his privately-funded 
exotic animal sanctuary 25 miles northwest of San Diego.

We call the little parrots 'hatchlings' in the business,
r'Bear added.

r'Bear established his exotic animal sanctuary two years 
ago with the help of several wildlife foundations.  If 
the breeding program is successful, the Foundations would 
like to reintroduce the species back into their natural habitat.  
In addition to Spix's Macaw, several other endangered 
exotics find a home at Shraavana.  The Arabian Oryx, the 
Golden Lion Tamerin and the Griffin Vulture were some of 
the first residents of the lush 5600 acre sanctuary.

We're hoping to add Trumpeter Swans when the lake is finished,
r'Bear explains as we drive past a large muddy construction 
area.  And if we can get a salt-water tank we might get a 
couple of Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtles.

r'Bear tells us most of his animals are purchased from 
overseas sources, but occasionally his agent gets a call from 
someone looking to find a home for their oversize boa.

We don't take those, he explains.  They're better off in a 
zoo where they can be, you know, taken care of by zoo 
professionals.
