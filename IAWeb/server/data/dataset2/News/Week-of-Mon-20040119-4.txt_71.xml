You know, all the recent news about mad cow disease has made me hungry.
And, apparently, I'm not the only one.

But I'm hungry for a big, juicy T-bone and a baked potato, not a cow brain
sandwich.

Even though the cows have begun to go mad here in the United States,
people refuse to give up their cow brain sandwiches.

That's right. Take Evansville, Ind., for instance, where noggin noshin' is
a tradition.
...
But, it's not just in Indiana. No.

In Stockton, Calif., cow brains are commonly sold as - oh . . . my . . .
gawd - taco filling and sold from the back end of some of the finest
pickup truck restaurants on the West Coast.
...
In Kentucky, eating squirrel brains served with fried eggs was once
considered a rural delicacy. Its popularity declined, however, after
researchers in 1997 found a possible link between eating squirrel brains
and contracting mad cow disease. Plus, ya gotta kill a heck of a lot of
squirrels before you have enough brains to add to that favorite Squirrel
Helper recipe.
...
Considering that mad cow disease - or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy-ex-pee-ala-docious - eats holes in your brain and is
incurable and fatal, you'd think that would be a really big turnoff. But
we Americans consider ourselves to be indestructible. In fact, we cannot
be killed and are immortal. And really, really stupid.

Those who do the whole deep-frying thing think they're safe. They figure
deep-frying will kill any bits of crazy cow on their Medulla Oblongata de
Cristo sandwich.

Well, bad news, Sparky. Cow brains have to be cooked to about 1,200
degrees to kill the rogue proteins called prions that cause the disease.
