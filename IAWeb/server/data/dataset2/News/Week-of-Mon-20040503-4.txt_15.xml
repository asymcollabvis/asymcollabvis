Xiao Fang, a squeamish housewife in the eastern China province of Jiangsu, 
never thought her husband would divorce her for killing a pet dog he had kept 
for seven years.

"Who's more important to him after all -- his wife or a dog?" asked the 
bewildered mother of a 17-year-old boy.

Earlier this year, Xiao and her husband bought a new apartment in the 
provincial capital Nanjing. "The new flat is nicely furnished and I didn't want the 
dog to mess it up," Xinhua quoted her as saying.

Xiao said she had tried to send the dog away in the first place, but failed. 
"Heihu was so clever that it managed to come back no matter how far I had 
taken him. So I hired four men to kill it when my husband was travelling on 
business."

Heihu, which literally means "black tiger", was the wolfhound her husband and 
son loved dearly. 

She was soon sorry for what she had done because the hostility from her 
husband and son was unbearable. Her husband, Xu, in his 40s, was beside himself 
when he learned of Heihu's death. 

"He was like as a member of our family to me. How could she be so cruel?"
Xu asked his wife, saying he could no longer live under the same roof with a 
murderer and divorce was the only way out.

The tragedy also saddened their son Xiao Gang, a senior high school student 
who for the first time in his life defied his mother.
