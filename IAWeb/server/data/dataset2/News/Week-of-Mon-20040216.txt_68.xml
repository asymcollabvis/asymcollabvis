"Some people are a whole lot worse off than I am," she said.
Working with local and state animal-rescue groups, she has resolved to find 
good, loving homes for each dog. Most of the animals are mutts - a Husky here, 
a terrier mix there. One is a German shepherd, another offers a bit of St. 
Bernard. All of Newlin's dogs are in good health, she said, and have been spayed 
or neutered. All are up to date on their shots. The dogs range from four to 11 
years old. Every one of Newlin's dogs, with the exception of the Husky mix, 
gets along with cats, and all of the dogs get along well with other dogs.
"All of her dogs are just so friendly and they're housebroken and they're 
just real lovers - they just want to be companions," said Pam Simmons with the 
Pet Rescue Foundation in Glen Allen that has been helping Newlin find homes. 
"We want to keep them out of the shelter," Simmons continued. She said once a 
dog reaches six years of age, it is not considered very adoptable. She 
believes that often people overlook the advantages of having older dogs as pets. 
"Some of their virtues are that they are calm and gentle," Simmons said. "The 
older dog knows the ropes and is easy to care for. Older dogs still play and they 
give their love just as much as the younger ones," Simmons added. 
Newlin said she wants more than anything for her dogs to find happy homes.
"I've called just about all the rescue people there are in the state," she 
said. But the competition is stiff for a good home. "There are so many millions 
of dogs that need homes; it's horrible," she said.</content>
