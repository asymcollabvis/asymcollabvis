My doctor's thin face came from behind my chart. "Why haven't you been 
renewing your estrogen patch?" I shivered in my blue paper clothes. 
"That scary study," I said. "You know, the one that proved hormone 
replacement therapy will kill me.'' 
In July 2002, a Women's Health Initiative study of Prempro, an estrogen-

stroke and pulmonary embolism. Later results showed that older users of the 
hormone had twice the rate of dementia as others. 
When it hit the headlines, the news scared everybody to death. "Forty- five 
percent of women stopped abruptly," says Risa Kagan, a gynecologist in the East 
Bay who often lectures on women's health. 
Then the news got even worse. Hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, which 
comes in various combinations and strengths and is prescribed to women to replace 
the natural sex hormones that wane as they age, did not even improve quality 
of life in such areas as mood, memory, sleep or sex drive. "For the average 
woman there is no effect,'' Jennifer Hays, lead author of the study, said at the 
time. 
Sales of Prempro dropped by half. My HMO sent out a letter warning of the 
dangers of HRT. 
Millions of women went back to their hot flashes and sweaty sheets. It is not
