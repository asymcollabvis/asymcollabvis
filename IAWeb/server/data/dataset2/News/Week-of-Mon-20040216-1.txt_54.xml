A poacher from a village of Kronshtadka in southern Primorye was fined $4,500 
by the Spassk district court on February 12 for killing an Amur tigress - of 
her two cubs one was later found dead while the other is monitored by 
ecologists in the wild, local news sources reported. 

According to televised reports from the court hearing Vasily Zelenin, 20, was 
sentenced to pay a fine of 130,000 rubles after the court found him guilty of 
slaying a tigress December 7. 

Court officials said that Zelenin, together with his companion, went hunting 
in the forest and spotted the tigress's tracks. Following them he soon saw the 
tigress sitting on the ground and killed her shooting three times from his 
rifle. 

Then Zelenin flayed the animal and hid its head and paws in a beehive in his 
yard. The next day experts from Special Tiger Inspectorate for the Protection 
of Rare and Endangered Species found the killed tigress and her dead cub 
nearby and launched a criminal investigation. Zelenin was detained by local police 
and admitted the crime giving law enforcers the tigress's skin, head and paws 
as well as his rifle and cartridges. Zelenin's advocate told the court that 
poverty caused Zelenin to kill the cat. </content>
