Woody Allen once remarked that he didn't want to achieve immortality through 
his work - he wanted to achieve it by not dying. Stephen Valentine could 
possibly do both. A self-professed visionary architect, Valentine has designed what 
could be the project of his career, and its purpose is to conquer death. 
Officially, the building is "the world's first comprehensive facility devoted 
to life extension research and cryopreservation", a six-acre structure that 
will house research laboratories, animal and plant DNA, and up to 10,000 
temporarily dead people. They will have paid to have their bodies (or perhaps just 
their heads) stored there until somebody works out a way to revive them. If 
Valentine is right, they won't have to wait too long. "This is going to be the 
century of immortality," he says. "Children being born today are probably going 
to live an average lifespan of 120 years. Their children, it is being 
predicted, will never die. There will be a time when people won't be able to 
comprehend the thought of not existing any more and just becoming fertiliser." </content>
