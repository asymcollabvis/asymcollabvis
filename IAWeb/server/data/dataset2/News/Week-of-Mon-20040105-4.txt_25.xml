Five months before the discovery of ``mad cow'' disease in the United 
States, Congress narrowly voted to let sick and injured cattle stay in the 
nation's food supply. Among California representatives, the more money a 
lawmaker received from the dairy and livestock industry, the more likely he 
or she was to support the controversial practice of turning so-called 
``downer animals'' into hamburger, steak and other meat, a Mercury News 
analysis has found.

California House members who sided with the dairy and livestock industry to 
defeat the measure last summer collectively received more than five times as 
much money in campaign contributions from those industries as California 
lawmakers who voted with consumer groups to end the practice, campaign 
spending records show.

Among the lawmakers who voted to continue the slaughter of downer cows for 
human consumption were two congressional representatives with districts on 
the Bay Area's doorstep: Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Stockton, and Rep. Dennis 
Cardoza, D-Merced.

Following last month's mad-cow discovery, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
banned all downer cows from the food supply last week.

Scientists have said for years that cows unable to walk are at higher risk 
for mad-cow disease, E. coli contamination and other food-borne diseases. 
The Washington dairy cow found to have mad-cow was a downer animal, as was 
the Canadian cow found last summer with the disease. McDonald's, Wendy's and 
Burger King won't accept downer meat, and the USDA forbids it in school 
lunches.</content>
