Vivisection: a 'moderate' proposal.

The problem with vivisection, argues Derrick Jensen, is
that
we’re experimenting on the wrong sort of animals.
To the dismay of many of my friends, I’m not unalterably
opposed to vivisection. In fact, I’d wholeheartedly support
it were vivisectors to make one minor administrative
change.
It would be that scientists perform the experiments not on
nonhumans but on themselves and their colleagues.
Scientists keep telling us how beneficial the experiments
are for Science with a capital ‘S’, Progress with a capital
‘P’ and, of course, Man with a capital ‘M’. If the
experiments really are Necessary with a capital ‘N’, the
scientists should be willing to make this sacrifice (with a
small ‘s’) for the greater good. In any case, according to
no other than Lord Sainsbury, UK minister for innovation
and
science, advocate of genetic engineering and owner of a
large supermarket chain, strict regulations ensure that
experiments generally cause no more than ‘moderate’
suffering. If this is actually true, scientists shouldn’t
object too much to throwing their hats into this ring.
Now, I’m sure you can spot the problem: there are too many
important experiments for the number of vivisectors. In
Europe alone an animal is killed in a laboratory every
three
seconds. In Britain it’s one every 12 seconds, in Japan one
every other second and in the USA one per second. I’m not
sure even full-fee scholarships and high salaries will
suffice to bring in enough scientists to fill this bill.
