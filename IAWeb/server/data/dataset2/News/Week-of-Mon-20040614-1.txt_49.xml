Alaska State Troopers arrived at a Soldotna musher's house last week to
find 15 dogs chained to their doghouses, no food or water in sight, ribs
showing through the layers of their husky fur.

Now, troopers' plans to give the dogs back to the owner have run into
opposition from the Alaska Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, which has the animals and says they shouldn't go back to an
abusive situation.

According to trooper Capt. Tom Bowman, the huskies' owner, Sigmund
Stormo, had paid a distant relative $10 a day to take care of his dogs
while he was away at a remote site on Kodiak Island for work. The
relative, whom troopers would not name, apparently did not do his job.
The dogs may have gone without food or water for 10 days.
