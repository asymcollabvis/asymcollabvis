In her 2002 book "Fashion Victim," Michelle Lee describes the cyclical nature 
of trends, with fur as a prime example. The ?80s were all about glamour and 
excess, and the fur industry in the U.S. saw enormous sales. 
The high was $2.3 billion in 1987. Yes, that?s billion with a "b." In one 
year. In the U.S. alone. 
But the early ?90s brought a new look to the fashion world. This was the era 
of Kurt Cobain, flannel shirts and Doc Martens. And though Tom Ford of Gucci 
might not have sent his models down the runway in dirty T-shirts and combat 
boots, the high fashion houses did begin to shy away from conspicuous consumption 
and all the shoulder pads, embroidery and yes, fur, that that implies. Fur 
sales bottomed out below the $1 billion mark in 1991. 
In the late ?90s, however, fur made a surprising comeback. Fur collars and 
coats were everywhere in 2000, from the runways of Paris (with Prada?s 
rabbit-fur "tippet" notably leading the way) to the discount stores of New Jersey. 
With the visible example of Naomi Campbell, those who had considered 
themselves anti-fur were suddenly torn between fashion and politics. The supermodel 
had long been a spokesperson for PETA when, in 1997, she pranced down the Fendi 
runway in an oversized Russian sable coat. The media enjoyed poking fun at her 
"brazen duplicity," but she wasn?t alone in her fickleness. </content>
