Just when I think I've seen and heard everything comes a series of diet
plans under the heading of "What Would Jesus Eat?" Even before
investigating further, I was sure that it would probably not contain Big
Macs, pizza or even a hot fudge sundae. I was right.
...
According to a report from the Associated Press June 7, "The Rev. George
Malkmus often preaches about how he believes the world of proper eating
began -- or, in his opinion, vegan.

" 'The Lord gave us everything we need in the Garden of Eden: fruits,
vegetables, nuts and seeds,' the preacher-turned-diet adviser said in an
interview at Hallelujah Acres, his North Carolina headquarters. 'That's
why we call the way we eat the Hallelujah Diet. We celebrate its true
creator.'
...
The vegans I've encountered are like any other zealot, in that they
believe their way is the only way. Some believe God will punish those
who do not adhere to their strict regimen.

These people are to the veggie world what Ted Nugent is to the
meat-eating world -- if it's possible to whack and stack veggies. I
don't know what's scarier, Nugent with his hunting bow and arrows, or a
vegan with a scythe.
...
If you choose to believe God is a hunter-gatherer, then the Gospel
According to Ted is probably going to be your cup of meat. If you
believe he was a pacific, wouldn't-hurt-a-fly kind of a guy, then by all
means, indulge yourself in all things vegetable.
