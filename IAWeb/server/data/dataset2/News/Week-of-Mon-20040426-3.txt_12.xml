If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. When it comes to the current laws regarding 
the withdrawal of feeding tubes in the terminally ill and permanently 
comatose, this sound bit of practical advice needs to be heeded.


But recently the Pope proclaimed that feeding tubes should never be 
withdrawn from any patient and that health-care providers are morally 
obligated to provide nutrition and hydration regardless of a patient's 
wishes. The Pope's order spells trouble for your health care -- not only 
because it threatens to undermine a powerful social consensus in the United 
States about your right to refuse medical treatment, but also because it 
means you can no longer be sure whether a hospital will respect your request 
or that of your loved ones making a decision for you.

In comments March 20 before the World Federation of Catholic Medical 
Associations, the Pope stated that patients who are permanently comatose are 
“always human” and “never become ‘vegetables’ or ‘animals.'" He went on to 
say that nutrition and hydration should be provided indefinitely even if 
there is no hope of a patient's recovery.


The Pope’s position is directly at odds with current clinical practice in 
U.S. hospitals. In the 1990 case of Missouri's Nancy Cruzan, the U.S. 
Supreme Court answered the question of whether food and water are medical 
treatments that can be declined. Cruzan was in a car crash that left her in 
a persistent vegetative state -- her brain did not get oxygen for many 
minutes and was so damaged that doctors said she could not possibly ever 
think or feel again. But, at the insistence of U.S. Attorney General John 
Ashcroft, who was then Missouri's state attorney general, Cruzan was kept 
alive by a feeding tube despite the wishes of her family.
