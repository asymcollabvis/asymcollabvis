ADAMS -- The traveling Walker Brothers Circus is coming to town Monday
after recently paying a $25,000 fine to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for 18 violations of the Animal Welfare Act.
...
According to various newspaper reports, the circus was recently charged
with a number of animal welfare violations, including failure to provide
veterinary care for its four elephants in 2001, one of which was
suffering from chemical burns and a bacterial infection. The circus
signed the settlement for the fine this year and agreed to pay it in
installments throughout 2004.
...
But there are some animal activists in the area who are against this
kind of entertainment, such as Paulette Wein of the Berkshire County
Advocates for Animals. On Friday, she said she had just heard about the
event earlier in the week and was unable to organize a protest.

"I am very much against circuses with animals," she said. "And it seems
like every year at these circuses we get more support. A few years ago,
a lot of people didn't understand what we were upset about. But I think
more are beginning to."

Wein said even if the circuses claim they treat the animals well, she
does not believe them because of what she has seen.

"I mean, they transport these animals in trucks, in the summer heat, in
the winter cold, kept in cages when they're supposed to be wild," she
said. "And the only way those animals could be contained backstage is
through cruel means, beating them into submission."
