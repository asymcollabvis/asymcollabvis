Debra Gurley does not want the circus to come to Los Alamos next week
because she alleges that circus animals are abused.

The Carson &amp; Barnes Five Ring Circus is being brought to town by the Los
Alamos Chamber of Commerce.

"I think there are just too many checks and balances for the Carson &amp;
Barnes Circus to abuse their animals," said Sue Hofmann, executive
director of the Los Alamos Chamber of Commerce said. "They cross so many
state lines and are inspected by so many agencies on a continual basis.
How could they possibly stay in business for 68 years if they mistreated
the very animals they rely on for their livelihood?"

Gurley disagrees.

"I will have to boycott any of our local businesses who support this by
selling tickets, provide advertising, or sponsorship. I will encourage
others to do the same," Gurley wrote in an e-mail to local businesses
forwarded to the Monitor on Saturday. 
...
"Once advertising starts appearing about the Carson &amp; Barnes Circus coming
to town, animal rights (activists) sometimes begin a campaign of
intimidation based on half-truths, misinformation and lies," said Alfrieda
Wilkins, a Carson &amp; Barnes spokesperson.
...
Jim Rogers, a spokesperson for the United States Department of Agriculture
in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C., said Carson &amp; Barnes
Circus has never been charged with a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
...
Rogers can be contacted at 202-690-4755 or jim.d.rogers@aphis.usda.gov.
...
The Monitor received a copy of one of those tapes.

PETA alleged in the tape that, "A Carson &amp; Barnes animal care director was
videotaped viciously attacking elephants with a bull hook, shocking
elephants with an electric prod, and instructing trainers to embed hooks
into the elephants flesh."</content>
