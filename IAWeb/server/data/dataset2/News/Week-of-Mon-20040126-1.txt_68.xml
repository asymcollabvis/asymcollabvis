Would you leave a loaded gun lying unattended around your yard, where anyone 
could have access to it?

No. That would be stupid.

Would you walk around town with an uncased, loaded gun?

No. That would also be stupid, not to mention illegal.

But hey, at least a gun wouldn't jump out of your backyard on its own will to 
shoot at those passing by. And your gun wouldn't leap from your possession to 
aim at those you meet on the

All the same, a gun is a very lethal thing, when not properly contained. That 
is why we don't often see folks leaving guns around their yard and dragging 
guns around the neighborhood.

Switch to a different scenario. An unleashed dog - one with large, powerful 
jaws that could tear through a human jugular without much problem. A dog that 
sees other smaller animals and children as little more than threatening chew 
toys. A dog whose owner has no visible control over it.

Unfortunately, it isn't uncommon to see these intimidating canines pacing 
freely around their owners' yard or walking several yards in front their owner 
while taking an afternoon walk together. It's something I have come upon more 
than a few times in my life. Frankly, I don't know most of the dogs I encounter 
when I stroll around town. Sure, they may be the friendliest man-eaters around 
- wouldn't hurt a fly and all that gibberish. </content>
