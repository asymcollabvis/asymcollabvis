 When she first walked a beat, New Bedford Police Officer Sheila C. Dolan 
learned something fast: This city has big dogs. 
 And that led to a second lesson. As a patrol officer, it's better to have 
the dogs on your side than face a suspicious pit bull or Rottweiler. 
 "All dogs are basically good," she said. "Good dogs, bad owners." 
 Now the 54-year-old officer is set to retire from the police department and 
has started her own dog-walking business, the first step in the transition 
from collaring perps to collaring pups. 
 Officer Dolan, a self-described "cat person," first started visiting with 
dogs in her South End patrol area. Before long, the socializing with her 
four-legged friends expanded. 
 "There were, like, 60 dogs I'd visit a day. Criminals would say, 'There's 
that crazy dog-girl,' " she said. 
 And do the dogs communicate back, a skeptical reporter asked? 
 "They do!" she insisted, adding that she always talks to the pets she cares 
for. "They like to hear someone talk to them." 
 While Officer Dolan never planned on getting a pup of her own until 
retirement, she changed her mind six years ago, when the owner of one dog on her daily 
round said he planned to put down his Akita. 
 "He didn't want to take care of him anymore," the officer said. "I didn't 
want a dog until I retired, but I wasn't going to let anything happen to my 
friend." 
 The dog, which weighs 97 pounds, now enjoys a life of ease at Officer 
Dolan's Fairhaven home. He was recently joined by Murphy Sullivan, a mixed black lab 
who is just over 2 months old. </content>
