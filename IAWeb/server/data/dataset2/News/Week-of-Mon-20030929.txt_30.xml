Family planning groups want the Government to relax
restrictions on the use of the controversial abortion pill
RU-486 despite the news that a fifth young woman has died
after the taking the drug.
The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, backed by the
Family
Planning Association, has asked the Department of Health to
cut the number of times a woman has to see a doctor in
order
to complete the procedure.

However, the move was greeted with alarm in America, where
the latest death occurred.

Senior gynaecologists there warned about the drug's safety
and argued that relaxing restrictions would increase the
risk to British women.
Their comments came after Holly Patterson, 18, from
California, died earlier this month from septic shock, a
week after taking RU-486 to abort her unborn baby. Four
other women have died due to bleeding or infection linked
to
the drug in France and the United States since its
introduction in 1988.
Dr Donna Harrison, a gynaecologist in Michigan, said
yesterday: "Regardless of their views on abortion there are
many doctors who are concerned about the safety of RU-486.
"There are so many things than can go wrong. There can be
bleeding serious enough for transfusions to be needed.
There
is also a serious risk of infection. If you don't want to
see a Holly Patterson in Britain you should reject any
moves
to relax medical supervision of these drugs."
