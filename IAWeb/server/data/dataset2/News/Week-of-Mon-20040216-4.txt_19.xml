  The drive to secure a British ban on live exports of horses, ponies and 
donkeys took a major step forward yesterday with signs of support from the 
European Commission.

South West Tory MEP Neil Parish is hopeful that his lobbying for a British 
ban on live exports could be successful.

Mr Parish has persuaded Dutch MEP Albert Maat, who is putting forward 
legislation on the transport of animals within the European Union, to include an 
amendment which would maintain Britain's "minimum values" legislation.

This protects low value horses, ponies and donkeys from the horror of live 
transport by pushing their value just above the meat value of the animals, so 
that they will not be transported live for slaughter.

Last night Mr Parish said his call for the minimum values ruling to stay in 
place had received a positive reception.

"It would be silly to say we have achieved a ban, but this is very positive 
news," he said.

"We are a long way down the road to getting the right legislation. I got some 
very positive answers from the European Commission about the derogation."

His optimism that the ban on live exports can be retained comes only a few 
weeks after Defra Minister Alun Michael, who has described himself as "Minister 
for the Horse", sparked outrage by refusing to lobby the EU on the matter. Mr 
Michael said he would not push the EU to close the loophole which would end 
the British ban on live exports.</content>
