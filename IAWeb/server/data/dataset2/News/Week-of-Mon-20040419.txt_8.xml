Four orphaned gorillas which arrived in South Africa last week should be sent 
to a sanctuary in Cameroon, the NSPCA said on Monday. 
The four primates from Cameroon, dubbed the Taiping Four, were orphaned when 
their parents were killed for bush meat in the west African country. 
The siblings, three female and one male, were smuggled from Cameroon to 
Nigeria and exported via South Africa to Taiping Zoo in Malaysia in 2001 on 
fraudulent documents. 
Rick Allan, spokesperson for the National Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals said the Limbe Wildlife Centre of the World Society for the 
Protection of Animals in Cameroon could accommodate the four western lowland 
gorillas. 
"They would be able to live out the rest of their lives in safety and 
security but in preferable conditions ? including climate, roaming area and 
integration with others of their species ? than can be provided by a zoo. In this 
proven facility, the animals' biodiversity behaviours will be satisfied." 
Allan said the Pretoria Zoo had one gorilla. "Five others have died there. 
The Taiping Four are in quarantine. South Africa has no native gorillas."
