It wasn't what you'd call an interview. Whoever was manning the keyboard
at the Earth Liberation Front Press Office refused to give his or her name
and insisted on communicating only by e-mail.

Still, it was worth a shot. The ELF released its Underground Direct Action
Totals for 2003 last week - and it turns out that one of the 75 acts of
eco-terrorism across the country occurred one autumn night right here on
the Portland peninsula.
...
It was far from the worst "direct action" taken last year by this
anonymous bowl of mixed nuts. The ELF's self-described "elves" claimed
credit for torching a $50 million, unfinished condominium complex in San
Diego last August, calling it "the largest act of environmental sabotage
in U.S. history."

Nor was it the most imaginative. Just after Thanksgiving, a splinter group
calling itself the "Vegan Dumpster Militia" left a pharmaceutical company
executive's house "covered in dumpstered food."
...
Final question: You say on your Web site that an ELF member could be
anyone - including "your partner." Is there something my wife isn't
telling me?

"The point is, you have no way of knowing who is involved," replied ELFPO.
"The ELF and other underground activists blend in on every level out of
necessity."

(Of course they do. Much as ELFPO and friends can't stand the American way
of life, it's a pretty comfy place to hide.)</content>
