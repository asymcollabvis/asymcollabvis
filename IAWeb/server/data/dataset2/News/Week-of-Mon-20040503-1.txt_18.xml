WASHINGTON ? The byproducts of a Texas cow that was destroyed after it
showed potential signs of a central nervous disorder must be made into pig
feed or be destroyed, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday. 

The FDA said it tracked down all the material from the cow that was sent
to a processor for rendering into animal feed and other products. All the
material is being held by a business that the agency did not name. The
government has said that none of it got into the human food supply.

The cow was destroyed before it could be tested for mad cow disease, an
incurable illness that eats holes in the brain, attacking the central
nervous system.
