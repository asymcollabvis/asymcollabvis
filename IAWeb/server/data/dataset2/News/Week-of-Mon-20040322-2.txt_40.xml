Baily was lucky. 
The white Maltese disappeared March 9 from an Island Park home, and by 
nightfall Baily's owners, including Chelsea Yakavuski, had put up 15 missing 
posters. 
Later that night, the family received an anonymous call stating that a couple 
in a white tow truck picked up the dog the night before. Yakavuski went 
line-by-line through the phone book and called every local towing company, but 
there was still no trace of Baily. 
More signs went up, ads were taken out in the newspaper and the family 
canvassed the neighborhood. 
Their legwork paid off a week later when they received a call from a woman in 
Arcadia who said she had Baily. The family retrieved the dog the next day and 
a new sign went up in Island Park thanking neighbors for their help and 
support ? Baily is home. 
"We have no clue how he got there, but we knew we would get him back," 
Yakavuski said. "There were people who doubted us, but we love this dog more than 
anything." 
More than two million pets are stolen every year across the country, though 
not many are granted homecomings like Baily's, said Chris DeRose, president of 
the Los Angeles based animal advocacy group Last Chance for Animals. 
DeRose estimated that one-third to one-half of stolen pets are sold to 
research firms, while others are sold to breeding companies (especially pure-bred 
males), some are used as food for both exotic animals and humans, while others 
are trained to fight. Some, DeRose said, are runaways or legitimately missing 
and, though rare, some family pets are held for ransom. 
"It's a nation-wide problem," DeRose said. "It goes on everywhere." </content>
