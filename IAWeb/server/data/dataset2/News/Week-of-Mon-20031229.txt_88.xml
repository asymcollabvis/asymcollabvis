U.S. tries to quell Japan's fears about safety of beef  
U.S. agriculture officials flew to Japan yesterday to address concerns in 
the world's largest market for American beef about the discovery of the 
first case of mad cow disease in the United States. Japan, which bought more 
than $1 billion of U.S. beef last year, joined more than two dozen nations 
that suspended imports after a cow in Washington state tested positive for 
the brain-wasting bovine disease last week. A delegation from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture led by David Hegwood, a trade adviser to U.S. 
Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, was scheduled to meet with Japanese 
officials in Tokyo today. 

FDA blasted over past enforcement of feed ban  
Long before mad cow disease appeared in Washington, the federal government 
slammed the Food and Drug Administration for failing to adequately enforce 
feed regulations, a key piece of the nation's firewall against the disease. 
On Wednesday, the FDA tried to reassure the public by saying it has 
"vigorously enforced" a 1997 law that bans the use of meat and bone meal 
from dead ruminants (cows, sheep and goats) in feed for live ruminants. The 
agency said more than 99 percent of feed operators are now complying with 
the law. 

Advanced Meat Recovery machine under scrutiny  
A slaughterhouse machine that blasts the last bits of flesh off cattle 
carcasses already relieved of their more recognizable cuts of beef is coming 
under increased scrutiny as the discovery of mad cow disease in Washington 
raises questions about the safety of the nation's food supply. The 
machinery, known as Advanced Meat Recovery, sometimes also strips off spinal 
cord tissue, which can slip into the food supply unknown to the consumer.
