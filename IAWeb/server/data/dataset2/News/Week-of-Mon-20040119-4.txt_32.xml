The temperature outside was only a whisker above zero Thursday morning, but 
Kadoodle and Pumpkin were toasty warm, sunning themselves in the window of the 
cat section at the Ark, a municipal animal shelter in Forest Park.

The blissful scene belied the cold reality faced by the cats and the rest of 
the 1,100 animals brought annually to the shelter by police, animal-control 
officers and citizens in the seven municipalities and one township it serves. On 
March 31, the Ark will lock its doors, a victim of insufficient financing and 
of its location on a piece of prime real estate on Forest Park's commercial 
and entertainment strip.

A vacant auto body shop in Forest Park is a possible new home for the Ark, 
but the shelter doesn't have $800,000 to buy and renovate the building, said 
Elliott Serrano, shelter manager.

Meanwhile, staff and volunteers are scrambling to find temporary quarters for 
200 or so animals, said Ellen Milad, coordinator of volunteers. Chances are 
good that all will get at least temporary placement in other shelters or in 
private "foster homes," but the long-term prospects are dim for the area's 
unwanted animals, she said.

"The number of stray dogs and cats always seems to increase in March," she 
said. "What will happen to the animals that would have been brought to the Ark 
if we were still here?"</content>
