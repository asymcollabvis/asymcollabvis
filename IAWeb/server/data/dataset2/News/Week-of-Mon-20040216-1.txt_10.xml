Tracey Woods, who runs the Great British Circus box office, said: "We are the 
first educational circus in the country in that we train our animals in front 
of the public and explain what we are doing.

"We feel in this day and age that we need to make it clear that we treat our 
animals with great care.

"The RSPCA inspects our circus every time we travel to a new venue. There 
have only been five prosecutions against touring circuses in the past 150 years.

"We have also won awards for our animal husbandry from World's Fair magazine, 
which is the circus industry journal.

"Animal rights protesters should concentrate on the owners of domestic pets 
who are up in court every day for cruelty."

CAPS has written to the owners of the Gardens asking them to prevent animal 
circuses using their land in the future.

A spokesperson for the Preston-based pressure group said: "By their very 
nature circuses cannot provide the space and necessary requirements to meet all of 
the complex needs of the animals.

"These animals will be touring the country for the next eight months, just to 
perform to the public for a few minutes. We are asking the public to boycott 
animal circuses and for shop-keepers not to display posters for circuses with 
animal acts.
