  <content>he Feline Conservation Federation, the nation?s 
oldest non-profit organization dedicated to excellence in exotic feline care is 
opposed to HB1151. ?It is part of the 11,000 animal bills and ordinances being 
proposed nation-wide this year at every level of government. There is an 
epidemic of hysteria orchestrated by animal rights extremists to sell an agenda 
that America won?t buy at face value, and it is a recipe for disaster?, said 
Lynn Culver, Legal Affairs Director of the FCF.

?The challenge of leadership is to avoid hysteria when tragedies happen, to 
be rational and informed so as not to do more harm then good. That?s why facts 
and statistics must supercede horror stories. There is an average of one death 
per year from big cat accidents in a population of 15,000. Statically this 
means driving a motor vehicle is three times more dangerous then keeping a 
tiger. The likelihood of a tiger escaping and killing a member of the general 
public cannot be calculated because it has never happened?, says Lynn Culver.
