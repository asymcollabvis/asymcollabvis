Then: When the California National Primate Research Center opened at UC
Davis in 1962, only the administration and lab buildings stood on County
Road 98, and the animals were housed on campus.

Through the years, the center has grown and studied many diseases ranging
from asthma to Alzheimer's disease, AIDS and other infectious diseases. As
one of eight primate centers supported by the National Institutes of
Health, the center conducts research in areas related to human health and
maintains a large breeding program to support that mission. The center
operates on a nearly $7.3 million annual base grant from NIH and
additional grant funding - $24 million in grants for research this
academic year.

The center has about 4,600 monkeys, mostly rhesus macaques with small
populations of cynomolgus monkeys and South American titi monkeys. And the
center employs nearly 300 workers, including scientists, veterinarians,
animal care technicians, specialists in pathology and animal husbandry,
graduate and postdoctoral students and laboratory and administrative
personnel.

The center sits on 300 acres, of which 80 acres is developed. Expansion
and improvement projects were proposed and studied in the last few years,
but were stalled by a lawsuit filed in January 2002 by animal rights
groups Animal Protection Institute of Sacramento and In Defense of Animals
of Mill Valley, challenging the environmental review. The groups claimed
the report didn't analyze alternatives to animal testing, which they said
would lessen impacts on the environment.</content>
