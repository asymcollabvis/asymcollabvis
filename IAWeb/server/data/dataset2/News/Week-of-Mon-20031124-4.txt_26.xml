Long-shot candidate says he wants to bring spiritual principles to governance.
...
Dennis Kucinich was expounding on his proposals for a
hasty exit from Iraq and a 15 percent cut in defense spending when a
member of Central Ohioans for Peace asked about something far deeper.

With the 57-year-old Cleveland congressman headed for a fund-raiser
sponsored by the Natural Law Party, which espouses the pantheistic message
of oneness and unity, the skeptical peace activist asked, "I wonder if you
feel sure of the dangers others see in aligning yourself with them?"

Kucinich answered by asking everyone to take a dollar bill out of their
pocket and to look closely at the eye at the apex of the pyramid on the
Great Seal.

"Here on the Great Seal of the United States we see an expression of
spiritual principles," Kucinich said. "So I think what we are here to do
is bring spiritual principles into the material world."

polish that personal wealth has bought some of the other contenders for
the seat he seeks.

"Is he electable?" said Ohio State University political science professor

a nuclear attack wipes out everyone else in government -- and even then he
would be carrying the wrong message to win."
...
It was on that journey that Kucinich met actress Shirley MacLaine, from
whom he borrowed a reported $20,000 that still shows up as unpaid on his
congressional financial disclosure report. He also met other
spiritualists, vegans and new-age crusaders who remain among his core
supporters.
