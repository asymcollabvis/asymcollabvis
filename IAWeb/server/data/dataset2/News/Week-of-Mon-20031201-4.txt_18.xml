People and insects aren't the only creatures on the planet that can grow a 
fungus for dinner. A salt marsh snail works the leaves of a plant in what 
researchers say looks like a simple form of farming.

cut adorned with droppings.

The snail Littoraria irrorata saws long gashes down the narrow leaves of the 
dominant plants in East Coast salt marshes. It doesn't eat the fresh tissue 
but instead waits until fungus riddles the leaf wound, explains Brian Silliman 
of Brown University in Providence, R.I. Snail droppings boost the amount of 
fungus that grows in the cut, say Silliman and Steven Y. Newell of the University 
of Georgia Marine Institute on Sapelo Island. They report in an upcoming 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the snails need to eat fungus 
to thrive. 
Previously, biologists had observed cultivation of edible fungus only in some 
beetles, termites, and ants (SN: 4/24/99, p. 261). The snail behavior "seems 
to be the first time fungal farming has been found outside of insects?and the 
first time in a marine system," says Silliman. "Fungal farming may be more 
widespread than we thought." </content>
