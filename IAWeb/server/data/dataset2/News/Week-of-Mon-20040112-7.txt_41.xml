Thanks to successful breeding experiments at the Krabi Coastal Aquaculture 
Centre, seven species of anemone fish once on the verge of extinction are coming 
back to the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. 
Finding Nemo may have left local theatres, but in the southern sea, a legion 
of brightly-coloured anemone fish, or pla cartoon, only recently arrived. For 
more than a decade, the population of anemone fish in the ocean has been 
shrinking. Thanks to their cuteness, the fish make for popular pets and thus they 
are often harvested from the sea to be sold at fish markets.

These little Nemos are quite vulnerable to environmental changes, though. 
Many suffer from the lengthy transportation times, becoming weak and plagued by 
disease on their way to the market. Most die a few days after being kept in a 
fish tank. </content>
