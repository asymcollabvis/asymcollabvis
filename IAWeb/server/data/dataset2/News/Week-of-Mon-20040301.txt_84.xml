  <content>Concerned about political fallout from a
second black bear
hunt, the McGreevey administration is quietly urging
wildlife officials
to cancel this year's hunt, several people close to
the issue said. 
 
The hunt is viewed by the administration as a negative
for Gov. James E.
McGreevey at a time when he is eagerly courting
support for an ambitious
land preservation plan in the New Jersey Highlands,
where the state's
bear population is heavily concentrated, sources said.

 
The Highlands plan, which seeks to curtail development
in a vast,
forested region in the state's northwestern counties,
is seen as an
important legacy for McGreevey, while the six-day hunt
last December
drew mostly negative feedback. Much of the criticism
leveled at the
administration came from people who live in the
region. 
 
McGreevey acknowledged recently that he has received
more letters
protesting the hunt - the state's first in 33 years -
than any other
public policy issue, including property taxes. More
than 14,500 people
wrote to the governor urging him to cancel the hunt,
while a much
smaller number, about 2,800 writers, said they favored
it, a spokeswoman
said.
