HI-TECH plastic bags which degrade in as little as 60 days are to be 
introduced at city supermarkets.



From the end of May, shoppers visiting Tesco stores in Peterborough will be 
given the new environmentally-friendly bags.

Green campaigners today said they would like other supermarkets and shops in 
the city to follow Tesco's lead and introduce the new technology.

The bags are made using an additive known as TDPA, which means they break 
down quickly and leave no harmful residues.

Following a trial last year, the bags are due to be introduced at Tesco 
stores across the country, including Tesco Extra at Serpentine Green, Hampton, 
Peterborough and Tesco Metro in Broadway, Peterborough by the end of May.

Tesco is the first UK supermarket to commit to offering all of its 13 million 
customers the chance to shop using totally degradable carrier bags.
