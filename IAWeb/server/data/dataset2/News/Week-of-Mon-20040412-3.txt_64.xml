PALM BEACH -- TJ and Neil Fisher hired an ex-CIA agent and offered $10,000
to find the person who's shooting and killing cats with a high-powered
pellet gun.

But that's not enough in the pricey neighborhood on the 100 block of
Seminole Avenue, where mansions go for millions. Now, the couple has upped
the offer to $25,000.

They hope someone will offer information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the person who pumped three pellets into Karuki, the
one-eyed orange tomcat the Fishers adopted last year.
