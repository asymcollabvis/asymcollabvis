  <content>Few could escape the shocking revelation over the festive period that one of 
the Queen's corgis was mauled by one of Princess Anne's terriers. As gloom 
descended over Sandringham, much of the nation responded to the story with an 
unseemly schadenfreude. 
A reader in The Guardian paid tribute to Dotty and Florence, "who have made 
everyone's Christmas so entertaining." The great British love of pets is 
tempered by a disdain for sentimentality: the darkest sin of the postmodern age. No 
wonder the Dotty episode -- with its batty owners and mad, bad, dangerous and 
much cosseted dogs, caused such glee.
