PLEASANTON -- After nearly two years of lobbying, an Oakland-based animal
welfare group will again argue for a ban on wild animal acts at the
Alameda County Fair.

A meeting -- hosted by the Fair Liaison Committee of the Alameda County
Board of Supervisors -- will be held Tuesday in a small conference room in
Oakland with room for only about 30 people.

Eric Mills of Action for Animals said his group purchased two half-page
newspaper ads to publicize the meeting.

The ads, which were published in today's Tri-Valley Herald and the Oakland
Tribune, cost$1,200, Mills said.
