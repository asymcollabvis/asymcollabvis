Thank God for PETA.

Before you madly search your home for tar and feathers, I am not a
card-carrying PETA member. Nor do I concur with many of the group's
"extremist" views or tactics. PETA's 2003 exhibit comparing factory farm
animals to Holocaust victims, for example, was a bad idea.

That said, however, I still thank God for PETA -- short for People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals.

The PETA folks have riled up more than a few ranchers and trappers,
infuriated many a meat eater and hunter, and prompted outrage from Bible
fundamentalists and game farm proprietors. They have crawled under the
skin of those people who feel animals were put on this planet merely for
human exploitation.

That's what they want to do. But PETA also does something else that hardly
any other group does with any regularity:

It stands up for those that can't speak for themselves. It sticks its neck
out. It takes chances. It displays a great deal of mettle for a cause it
profoundly believes in.
...
Thanks to PETA, McDonald's, Burger King, KFC and Wendy's have all
inaugurated animal welfare research programs. PETA also has been in the
trenches in the battles against dogfighting and cockfighting.
...
The commercial was a bit risqu?, perhaps, but humorous and fairly tame
when compared to the Super Bowl's halftime show and some of the other
lackluster commercial spots. The gist of PETA's ad was that eating meat
causes impotence. (You can view the 30-second ad at
www.peta.org/feat/superbowl/.)
...
Subtly and slowly, but surely and assuredly, PETA is changing the American
consciousness. At times, change is imperceptible.

We may view PETA's actions as outrageous and radical, hardly giving them a
second thought.

But I can't help but ponder: A decade or two down the road, might we
wonder what took us so long to understand?</content>
