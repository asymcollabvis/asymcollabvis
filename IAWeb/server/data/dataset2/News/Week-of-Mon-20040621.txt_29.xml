Many are aware of the controversial decision by the AKC to accept its High 
Volume Breeders Committee recommendation to once again include and recruit 
commercial breeders back into the AKC.  As part of their study the High Volume 
Breeder Committee, chaired by National Animal Interest Alliance founder Patti 
Strand, visited the Hunte Corp headquarters in Goodwin, MO and one of Petland's 
flagship stores.  Hunte is the largest puppy mill broker in the US, while 
Petland has gained a reputation of having problems with commercially raised puppies 
for years.  
 
Thanks to the efforts of Strand and the recommendations of the HVBC pet 
consumers can know purchase an AKC registrable puppy in any of the Petland stores 
located across the country.  Now comes the next step in the AKC's growing 
partnership with large scale High Volume Breeders - which many refer to as simply 
puppy mills.  The AKC is offering to allow any "breeder in good standing" to 
advertise on the AKC.  Suddenly the line between commercially bred irresponsible 
breeding and the devoted dog fancy who breed responsibly becomes more clouded 
and difficult to see.
 
I have often written that devoted responsible breeders need not fear those 
seeking to end irresponsible breeding but need to pay close attention to the AKC 
role in turning products of the puppy mills into "brand" names.  How long 
will it be before the phrase "AKC registered" doesn't mean a hill of beans.
