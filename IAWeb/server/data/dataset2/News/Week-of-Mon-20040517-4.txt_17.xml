The Animal Liberation Front is claiming responsibility for breaking into a
Brigham Young University barn and releasing a small number of rabbits and
birds.

BYU spokeswoman Carrie Jenkins said Friday that between 2:30 p.m. on
Sunday and 8 a.m. on Monday an unknown number of suspects entered the
small barn through a window.

The Salt Lake Tribune received an e-mail Friday from Bite Back magazine,
based in Florida, which advertises Animal Liberation Front activities.

The e-mail says the group released six rabbits, five finches and two
doves, though Jenkins was unable to confirm the number of missing animals.
