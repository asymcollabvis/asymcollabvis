An animal-welfare group hopes to neuter up to 200 cats in San Antonio by 
pricing surgeries at 5 cents per feline, in an effort to prevent the unwanted 
breeding of thousands of kittens. 
Tuesday's "Neuter Scooter for a Nickel" promotion of the nonprofit 
Spay-Neuter Assistance Program (SNAP) is expected to neuter more than 1,500 cats 
statewide. 
The promotion, in its ninth year, is part of a national "Spay Day USA" 
campaign by the Doris Day Animal Foundation that encourages spaying and neutering of 
cats and dogs. 
Besides adding to public health concerns such as cat bites and occasional 
rabies cases, uncontrolled breeding leads to a harsh life for homeless cats, said 
Marcy Lynch, community program manager with SNAP. 
A stray normally lives 2-3 years, compared with 15 or more years for a cat 
that is cared for. 
"It seems every neighborhood has its own colony of stray cats," Lynch said. 
"But I think there's greater awareness that this is a problem." 
Strays often contract feline AIDS or leukemia. Others become victims of 
cruelty, or are hit by cars. Strays that land in shelters are among the luckier 
ones, Lynch said. 
"Disease is a big killer of strays," she said. "Because of the (solitary) 
nature of cats, when they're sick or injured, they just go some place to die." 
Seven local clinics will accept cats Tuesday morning and release them in the 
afternoon. Surgeries are free for pet owners on public assistance. To request 
an appointment, call (210) 673-7722 and leave a message. 
Cat owners are asked to show proof of rabies vaccination. Rabies shots will 
be $7.50, or free for people on government aid. 
Dr. Jim Weedon, a local veterinarian and SNAP's director of operations, said 
neutering is perhaps the best form of feline birth control, since a tomcat can 
produce many litters.</content>
