 When everything is working right, an e-mail message appears
 to zip instantaneously from the sender to the recipient's
 inbox. But in reality, most messages make several momentary
 stops as they are processed by various computers en route
 to their destination.

 Those short stops may make no difference to the users, but
 they make an enormous difference to the privacy that e-mail
 is accorded under federal law.

 Last week a federal appeals court in Boston ruled that
 federal wiretap laws do not apply to e-mail messages if
 they are stored, even for a millisecond, on the computers
 of the Internet providers that process them - meaning that
 it can be legal for the government or others to read such
 messages without a court order.

 The ruling was a surprise to many people, because in 1986
 Congress specifically amended the wiretap laws to
 incorporate new technologies like e-mail. Some argue that
 the ruling's implications could affect emerging
 applications like Internet-based phone calls and Gmail,
 Google's new e-mail service, which shows advertising based
 on the content of a subscriber's e-mail messages.
