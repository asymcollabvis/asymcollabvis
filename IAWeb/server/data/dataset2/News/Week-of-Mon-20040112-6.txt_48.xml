A single case of Mad Cow disease on a dairy farm in the United States last
month has sent shock waves through the nation's $175 billion beef
industry. But as journalist and veterinarian Mark Jermone Walters claims
in his book Six Modern Plagues: and How we Are Causing Them Mad Cow is
just part of a wave of new global infections. Since the Washington state
mad cow incident was first reported last month, 36 countries have banned
the import of U.S. beef and a study by the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association reports a 15 percent drop in cattle prices, a significant
shock to the U.S. farm economy.

A CNN-Time poll released last week says 27 percent of Americans have
either reduced their consumption of beef or stopped eating it altogether.

"And so you find this whole range of new infections, from old to new that
is reconfiguring itself. It is mutating," said Mr. Walters. "There is some
reason that this is all happening together. And the reason is that we have
made radical changes in the environment and thereby put humans in the way
of diseases that evolutionarily did not tend to mess [bother] us very much."

Mr. Walters says in his introduction to the book that the larger story is
not simply that humans and other animals are falling victims to new
diseases, but that humans and animals are causing these diseases or making
them worse.

unfortunately," he adds, "do the plagues we are all now experiencing."</content>
