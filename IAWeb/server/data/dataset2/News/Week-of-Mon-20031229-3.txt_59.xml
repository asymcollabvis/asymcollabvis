  Stories: Animal
There were no reindeer outside the Loblolly Treasures Christmas Shop, near 
Woodside, during the holidays. 
The two reindeer that had lived at the family-operated farm and business have 
died. 
One, Holly Berry, died several months after she escaped from her owners just 
before Christmas 2002 and led pursuers on a chase through central Kent County. 
The pregnant, 250-pound animal and her unborn fawn were found dead in late 
March. 
The family's second reindeer, a young male named Sebastian, died four months 
after that. His owners think he died from lack of companionship. 
"He needed his mate," owner Cheryl Epps said. The family tried to comfort 
Sebastian by having him visit with other animals, including goats, sheep and 
horses, but he stopped eating and started losing weight. They also tried to buy 
another reindeer, but none could be delivered in time. 
Epps said that despite the loss, she is not giving up. A new pair of reindeer 
are on order, a male and a female, which will be delivered this month. 
Epps said she hopes eventually to have a herd at her store. "I want a whole 
family of reindeer like Santa," Epps said.
