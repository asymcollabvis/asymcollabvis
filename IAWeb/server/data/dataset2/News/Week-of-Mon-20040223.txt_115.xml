Marathon running is synonymous with carbo-loading. So what if you're on
the Atkins Diet?

Do you bacon-binge? Cheddar-load? Is it enough to skip the bun on a
double-bacon cheeseburger?

In other words, what if you haven't seen a bagel in six months and your
carbohydrate-rationed body now finds itself entered in the 26th running of
the Cowtown Marathon on Saturday?

"Truthfully, I think you'd be in trouble," said Fort Worth Runners Club
president Frank McGinty, who said he has run 52 marathons.

Two things are fairly consistent about marathon running: Your body needs
energy, and your body needs fuel.

Buddy, can you spare a carb? simply is not acceptable language around the
start of a 26.2-mile race.

Nancy Clark, a Brookline, Mass., sports nutritionist and author of two
books -- Food Guide for Marathoners and Sports Nutrition Guidebook --
makes it clear that she's not a proponent of the Atkins Diet for anyone,
much less a marathoner.
...
"[But] if you're on the Atkins Diet and trying to run a marathon, you
deplete muscle glycogen, which never gets replaced," Clark said. "Because
you're not taking in carbs, your muscles don't have the fuel to function.
... They just stop. Your body lacks stamina and endurance. Basically, it's
no fun to run."
...
"If foods high in carbohydrates are fattening, then why aren't marathon
runners fat?" Clark asked, rhetorically. "Carbs aren't fattening. Calories
are fattening. Lack of exercise is fattening."

Local marathon runner Michael Polansky, who operates Polansky Race
Management, has been a vegetarian since 1979. Carbs come easily.
