  <content>A 25-year-old man suspected of poaching a trophy-size 
bighorn sheep posted a $50,000 bond Tuesday afternoon to get out of Garfield 
County Jail. 
Joshua Eli Lloyd, of Glenwood Springs, was arrested by Colorado Division of 
Wildlife officials in Glenwood Canyon around 10 p.m. Sunday after he allegedly 
tried to recover the partially-concealed head of his kill from a culvert north 
of Interstate 70, DOW area wildlife manager Pat Tucker said. 
Glenwood Canyon is a well-known habitat for the state?s official mammal, the 
bighorn sheep. 
?It was just a head cut off at the neck and stuffed in a plastic bag,? 
Tucker said on Tuesday. 
The head was discovered by a fisherman Sunday just north of Interstate 70 in 
the Grizzly Creek area. 
?They were out hiking and found it,? Tucker said. ?We found the rest of the 
body on the hill.?
Lloyd was arrested on three charges: a felony charge of willful destruction 
of wildlife; a charge of illegal possession of wildlife, which carries fines 
ranging from $1,000-$100,000; and a charge of violating Colorado?s Samson Law. 
Under the state?s Samson Law, illegal killing of trophy-size wildlife carries 
a $25,000 surcharge. Wildlife biologists said the ram Lloyd is suspected of 
killing was 81?2 years old, with a three-quarter horn curl. Any ram with a half 
curl ? where the horn has grown at least through half or 180 degrees of a 
circle ? meets the Samson classification, a DOW news release said. 
Lloyd is suspected of shooting the bighorn out of hunting season, without an 
appropriate license and in an area where bighorn hunting is never allowed.</content>
