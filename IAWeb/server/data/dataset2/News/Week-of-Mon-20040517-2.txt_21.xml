UNC has once again come under allegations of animal mistreatment from People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights organization which 
carried out an investigation in the Thurston Bowles science building. An unnamed 
undercover investigator documented the alleged abuses over the span of nearly a 
year. 
UNC has once again come under fire from People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals, which is requesting medical organizations to revoke federal funding to 
the University after evidence of laboratory animal abuse.
An undercover investigator for the animal rights group employed by the 
University documented the abuse in the Thurston Bowles science building, the same 
building where PETA had made similar allegations of abuse in 2002.
The investigator, who documented the abuse from January to November, was not 
identified because she is now participating in another investigation.
Her investigation revealed instances of animal abuse including mice with 
oversized tumors that had ulcerated and burst, seriously sick and injured animals 
left to die without any veterinary care and severe overcrowding, leading to 
"cannibalism and suffocation."
  
PETA's report against UNC cites numerous instances of animal abuse, including 
improper veterinary care and mice with oversized tumors that had ulcerated. 
The investigator also found instances of clipping animals' toes for the 
purpose of identification and improper euthanization techniques. In one instance, a 
guillotine blade was so dull that two fully conscious rats' necks were hacked 
twice in order to sever their heads from their bodies, said Mary Beth 
Sweetland, a PETA senior vice president.
