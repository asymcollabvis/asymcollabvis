Just moderately reducing consumption of ?trans fats? found in
hydrogenated fats may cut coronary heart disease by a quarter, according
to a leading expert, a Health Which? investigation reveals. However,
many food retailers are failing to help address the problem.

Health Which? is a UK Consumer?s Association Watchdog. 

Hydrogenated fats/oils (found in countless ingredients lists for all
kinds of foods)are formed by bubbling hydrogen through vegetable oil and
are used to extend the shelf life of the oil. But in the process trans
fats are created, which many experts, including the Food Standards
Agency (FSA), now firmly link to coronary heart disease and believe
could be even worse than saturated fats.

Hydrogenated fats and therefore trans fats are found in a range of food
products, including those aimed at the ?healthy? market, such as
Kellogg?s Nutri-Grain morning bars. Linda McCartney vegetarian sausages
and flame grilled burgers as well as a wide variety of biscuits, cakes,
crackers, packet soups, pies and many takeaway fast foods also contain
hydrogenated fats.
