OCEAN CITY -- The raccoons are coming. They want your trash, already
sniffing those aromatic banana peels and coffee grounds, and they'll
invade your garbage can to get it.

Wildlife control cooperators say they're ready for the onslaught.

A handful of people on the Eastern Shore are deputized by the state to
respond to complaints of raccoons in the garbage, squirrels in the attic
and even foxes in the henhouse.

They hold Department of Natural Resources wildlife control cooperator
permits that allow them to use animal traps year-round, beyond the winter
trapping season and for-hire. Picking up where common pest control
companies leave off, they are called to remove, and sometimes kill,
medium-to-large mammals that are bothering families at home, businesses or
farms. 
...
Trappers say that contrary to popular belief, animals they catch don't
have to die, and often don't, although wildlife cooperators are allowed to
kill animals and must do so if they could be rabid. Often, a trapper will
confiscate an animal and release it away from the built-up area. They say
this happens often with pets off leashes that come upon traps. Scents and
bait are used to lure animals into traps that snare their feet or grip
their whole bodies.
...
Animal rights groups often object to trapping practices. Bills that aimed
at forbidding the use of leghold traps, sponsored by several Western Shore
lawmakers, failed in the General Assembly this year.
