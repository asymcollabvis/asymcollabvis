It's 6:15 a.m., Nov. 20, and cold -- or at least, as cold as November 
mornings in Orlando get. The temperature has dipped into the low 50s, and we're 
standing in the parking lot of the University of Central Florida Arena, anxiously 
awaiting the warmth of a chartered bus due here 45 minutes ago. With me is a 
writer from the Central Florida Future, about 35 student activists from the 
school's campus.Peace.ACTION group and two older women sporting Dennis Kucinich 
T-shirts.
"Lousy union labor!" one student yells, a reference to the missing bus. He's 
shot a look of remonstration, and recants: "I'm just joshing." 
We're not the only ones growing impatient. Channel 13 sent a reporter out to 
film the students getting on the bus, and she's now behind schedule. While we 
wait, ACTION leader Emily Ruff passes around a release form that includes a 
space for next of kin. 
"What's it for?" one student asks. 
"If you get arrested," Ruff responds. 
"Not if, when," another student chimes in, and the group laughs. 
Ruff instructs us to break into groups of two or three -- the buddy system -- 
and gives us gauze, bandages and latex gloves. One student activist is 
commended for having a poster that's not attached to a carrying stick: Sticks can be 
considered weapons, I'm told, and where we're going, having such a weapon 
could get you beaten or tear-gassed. Another student uses red tape to fashion a 
cross on the front and back of his white sweater. He will be the group medic. </content>
