Summer months spark a boom in the pet population. And 
a 6 News investigation found that a record number of animals in East Tennessee 
are literally dying for adoption. 
During the warm months, most animals in East Tennessee shelters will only see 
one pair of caring hands. The ones that may also have to take their lives. 
It's breeding season and before summer is over, hundreds of unwanted cats and 
dogs will pass through shelters. 
During a visit to the Oak Ridge animal center, the 6 News crew saw strays, 
surrenders, full growns and newborns. But workers said the majority will never 
find a home.

Experts say the reason is simple, irresponsible people. "This isn't a car you 
just can't put it on the sidewalk and leave it sitting there," said Oak Ridge 
animal control Officer Brian Porter. "These things breed. They eat, hurt, 
die, the whole spectrum. But yet, they're considered a piece of property."
