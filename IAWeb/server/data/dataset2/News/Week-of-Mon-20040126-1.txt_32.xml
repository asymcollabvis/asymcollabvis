DELMAR - There is a dogfight going on between at least two area women as they 
debate the reasons behind the deaths of seven dogs.
The battle began after the dogs were found dead at the home of Robin Conner 
of Delmar. Charges of four counts of animal neglect were filed against her Jan. 
14 after a complaint was made by the Muscatine County Humane Society.
The humane society called the Clinton County Sheriff's Office based on a 
report by Mollie Kling of rural Walcott, who had been notified by Conner that four 
of her English Bulldogs had died while in Conner's care. Three more dogs, two 
of them Kling's, also were found dead on the property. As a result, several 
animals were taken from Conner's home.
According to Kling, Conner had the four dogs for only six weeks. She 
initially told Kling that the dogs must have gotten into some poison, but later Conner 
stated that the dogs had escaped about Dec. 16 and she had found them dead 
near a tree nursery.
"My hobby is showing dogs, and I had a contract with Conner to raise some 
litters," Kling said. "I called to check on the dogs often and she would tell me 
that the dogs were fine, but then she stopped calling me back after the first 
of this year. Finally, on Jan. 5th, she called and told me my dogs had died."
An autopsy performed by a veterinarian showed they had most likely died from 
starvation and exposure.
