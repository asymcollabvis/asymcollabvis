The university lecture hall in Boston is strangely crowded for a Saturday
morning in summer. Inside 100 lawyers, nutritionists, academics and
public-health officials are lapping up a talk by Marion Nestle, a
nutrition professor from New York University. Nestle seems to be enjoying
herself too. On to the projector screen pops a photo of an Oreo
cookie-counting book, designed to teach toddlers to count. "It counts down
from 10 to one," says Nestle. "You start with 10 cookies and eat them one
by one. At about 50 calories a piece, that's at least 500 calories!"
Laughter from the lawyers.
...
Today, Nestle is the keynote speaker at the first annual conference on
"Legal Approaches to the Obesity Epidemic". Here at Northeastern
University in Boston is gathered a group that wants nothing less than to
change the way the $900bn-a-year US food industry operates - and,
ultimately, the way that America eats.

Banzhaf teaches a course in public-interest law dubbed "sue the bastards"
by his students. (He has no objection; his car's number plate reads SUE
BAST.) His course requires students to come up with ideas for
public-interest cases. In 2001, a group of students had developed a
complaint against McDonald's over its claim that it cooked its French
fries in 100 per cent vegetable oil. A vegan student in Banzhaf's class
had discovered that McDonald's pre-cooked them in beef extract. An
attorney brought the case on behalf of a group of Hindus, barred by their
religion from eating beef, and won an apology and a $10m donation to
charity from McDonald's. Banzhaf calls it the first successful "fat"
lawsuit, and thinks it could be a model.
