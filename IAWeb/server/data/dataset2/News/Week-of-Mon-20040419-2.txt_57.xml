Justice hearing on a bill to outlaw hog-dog fighting. 
A heavily amended -- and opposed -- bill aimed at outlawing fights between 
dogs and hogs cleared a House committee Wednesday. 
Rep. Warren Triche, D-Thibodaux, told the House Committee on the 
Administration of Criminal Justice that he had significantly changed his House Bill 1244 
to mollify opponents. 
Those opponents included former Sen. B.B. "Sixty" Rayburn, who told the 
committee that late Gov. "Uncle" Earl Long first took him hog hunting in 1948. 
"This is the most discussed bill this session," said committee Chairman Rep. 
Danny Martini, R-Metairie. 
Proponents showed television coverage of a hog-dog fight in Clarke County, 
Ala. The report showed smiling families watching a pit bull rip the head of a 
hog whose tusks had been removed. 
Members voted 8-3 for legislation that would outlaw spectator events in which 
dogs attack feral hogs with the intent or likelihood is that one of the 
animals would maim or kill the other. 
The reconfigured HB1244 would allow hog hunting, hog herding, hog trials and 
other hog-related sporting events, Triche said. 
Hog-dog trials involve trained dogs chasing and chomping down -- often on the 
ears -- a penned feral hog.
