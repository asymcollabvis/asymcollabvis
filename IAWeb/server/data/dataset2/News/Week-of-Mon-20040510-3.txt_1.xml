 Johannesburg man has been fined R4,000 by the Randburg Magistrate's Court 
for failing to adequately care for his exotic birds. The court, however, ruled 
that Mike Henn should remain the legal owner of the birds despite the sentence, 
police have confirmed. 
The case stems from the seizure of 51 exotic birds from Henn's ammunition 
warehouse in Strydom Park by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals (NSPCA) in October 2002. 
Evidence before the court was that the birds had been living in cages with 
decaying rat corpses and were poorly fed. The cages were also full of bird 
excrement and were unhygienic. 
Henn appeared briefly in court on Saturday and was found to have violated the 
Animals Protection Act of 1962. He was sentenced to a R4,000 fine (or 12 
months imprisonment). 
The court refused the NSPCA's application for ownership of the birds. 
The birds had been in the custody of the NSPCA since their seizure and the 
organisation intended placing them in a sanctuary where they would not be bred 
or traded. 
The court said it felt Henn had learned his lesson.
