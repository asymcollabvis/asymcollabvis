Some people look at a cute little piggy or liquid-eyed cow and wonder
what it?s thinking or maybe what its name is. I just wonder if it would
taste better with ketchup while the rest of it becomes a nice pair of
shoes or a jacket.

There are others who wonder how to free the oppressed, captivated animal
(circuses are a favorite target). Most of these fall under the umbrella
of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, perhaps the biggest
bunch of nuts I?ve ever seen. Bag them up and you could sell them at the
circus.
...
PETA?s problem is a lack of perspective. Animals should be treated as
humanely as possible, but you can?t attribute actual rights to them. At
best, you can outline responsibilities their owners have. In the end
they?re just critters. Human welfare is much more important.

What can I say? I love animals. They?re entertaining and they taste
great. Especially on a Killer Burger.
