Recent shipment of cane rat meat that came into Hartsfield-Jackson 
International Airport 
Inspectors at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport, suspicious of a smoky 
odor wafting from the suitcase of a passenger arriving from Cameroon in Central 
Africa, peered into her bag.
They were shocked by what they saw -- an entire smoked monkey. The meat, the 
woman said, was intended for a traditional wedding reception of some African 
immigrants.
"It was obviously a monkey, but we couldn't identify the species," said 
Patricia Rogers, a federal wildlife agent at the airport.
In August, two large monkey heads seized from a passenger arriving in Atlanta 
from Senegal apparently were intended for consumption by a family of 
immigrants, authorities said.
Airport inspectors from New York to Hawaii are reporting similar findings as 
a demand for "bush meat," or wild animal flesh, mostly from Africa, increases 
in the United States. "We're probably seeing only the tip of the iceberg," 
said Mike Elkins, deputy wildlife agent in charge at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service's regional office in Atlanta.</content>
