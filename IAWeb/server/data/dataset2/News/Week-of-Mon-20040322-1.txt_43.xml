  <content>A U.S. District Court judge this week will unseal a search
warrant and affidavit that could reveal why the FBI arrested a peace
activist it never charged in connection with ecoterrorism in the San
Gabriel Valley.

Pomona resident Josh Connole's attorney said the decision by the U.S.
Attorney's Office to no longer oppose the unsealing of the affidavits,
just 10 days after another man was charged with the crimes, is a "tacit
admission' that the FBI arrested the wrong man the first time.
...
Connole has fought to have the documents unsealed to clear his name in the
Aug. 22 attacks, saying the FBI has a history of "smearing peace activists.'

Connole, 25, claims he was arrested because of his opposition to the Iraq
war, and that the documents will show the FBI falsely arrested him.
...
Caltech student and Pasadena resident William Cottrell, 23, has been
indicted on nine counts connected with the arson and graffiti attacks that
destroyed 133 vehicles and caused $3.5 million in damages. If convicted on
all counts, he faces 35 years to life in federal prison.

Earth Liberation Front, an international ecoterrorist group advocating
economic sabotage to protect the environment, took credit for the attacks
on sport utility vehicles at car dealerships and residences in the Valley,
spurring a massive FBI investigation.
...
Connole is a vegan and a self-described antiwar peace activist who lives
in a co-op in Pomona that promotes communal living, environmental
sustainability and social justice.
