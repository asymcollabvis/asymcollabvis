Consumers may care more about country of origin labeling (COOL) than you 
would imagine. A new poll by the National Farmers Union (NFU) shows strong support 
for such labels among consumers, backed up with a willingness to pay a little 
more for labeled foods, and an inclination to buy food produced in the US. 
The poll is the centerpiece of a one-day Washington, DC fly-in by NFU taking 
place today. 

This afternoon the Senate will hold a cloture vote on the omnibus 
appropriations bill that includes an amendment delaying implementation of mandatory COOL 
rules until September of 2006. NFU estimates close to 100 farmers, ranchers 
and consumers from across the country will visit Senate offices today, ahead of 
the vote. R-CALF USA will join NFU for the grassroots action.

"Farm and consumer organizations representing more than 50 million Americans 
want the country-of-origin labeling law implemented without delay," says NFU 
president Dave Frederickson.</content>
