Long before supermarkets devoted aisle space to organic produce, tofu
and free-range chicken, there was the George Street Co-op in New
Brunswick.

Started in 1973 by members of the Vegetarian Club at Rutgers College,
the co-op has survived three decades, filling a niche for consumers
seeking healthy alternatives. 

But now that organic food has gone mainstream, the co-op is struggling
to find its place.

"You can buy natural foods in every regular supermarket," said Bill
Zietlow, the co-op's general manager.
