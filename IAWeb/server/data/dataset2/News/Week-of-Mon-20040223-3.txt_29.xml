A form of avian influenza has been floating around at the Little Rhody Egg 
Farm in Foster, Rhode Island for over a year killing 2,000 birds last spring. On 
February 23rd, 30 Department of Environmental Management and U.S. Department 
of Agriculture officials arrived at the farm to begin killing the entire flock 
of 30,000 chickens to prevent the spread of the disease. 
Since when has this nation become so desensitized that the slaughter of 
30,000 animals (seven times the population of Foster, RI), hardly causes us to bat 
an eye. A 1983?1984 H5N2 virus epidemic (a more potent and lethal strain of 
the avian influenza) in the US resulted in the destruction of more than 17 
million birds (at a cost of nearly $65 million). To me it seems like such a waste. 
It's disgusting that "industry" has become this powerful and that profits far 
outweigh the concerns of keeping animals healthy, thus keeping the public 
healthy. But I suppose the large amounts of antibiotics (more than 70% of all the 
antibiotics used in the US are for farm animals) that are fed or injected 
into factory farm animals as part of their daily routine of eating while 
constantly caged (compensation for over-crowded and unsanitary conditions conducive to 
infections) are the "preventative measures" that we keep hearing about 
whenever an infectious outbreak occurs. </content>
