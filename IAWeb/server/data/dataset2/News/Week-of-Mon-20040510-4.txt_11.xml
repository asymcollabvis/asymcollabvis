A contentious chapter in the history of Collier County Domestic Animal 
Services ended this week with a final report by an independent investigator 
concerning allegations of mismanagement. 
Mike Carr, who investigated the agency for a local private animal shelter 
Friends of Gummi, said his findings won't go to a grand jury to test if criminal 
prosecution is in order. But he recommended a new approach to dealing with 
animal cruelty cases that will have department staff doing a better job 
collecting evidence to prosecute such cases. 
"(State Attorney) Steve Russell was thrilled that that was in the report," 
Carr said. "The training (animal control officers) was they were being told to 
issue civil citations when they caught people doing things that are crimes." 
Carr offered glowing compliments for how county officials handled the 
emotionally charged situation around DAS that had employees and former employees as 
well as outsiders alleging mismanagement. 
He said in his interim and final reports that, among other problems, the 
department failed to auction all livestock and also allowed some to go to staff at 
discount prices, including valuable exotic birds that went to an animal 
control officer who raises and sells them and some livestock that were used for 
food.
