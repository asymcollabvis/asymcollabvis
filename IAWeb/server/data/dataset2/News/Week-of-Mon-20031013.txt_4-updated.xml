The multibillion-dollar business of buying and 
selling protected wildlife is one of the largest 
sources of criminal earnings, behind only arms 
smuggling and drug trafficking.The United 
States is the main destination for exotic and 
endangered wild animals. National, state, 
and local governments are passing laws that prohibit 
the capture and sale of certain species, but 
most of these regulations are poorly enforced 
and are designed to protect humans from disease 
rather than ensure that animals are handled humanely.

It can be difficult to sort out what government 
regulations exist to control the influx of 
exotic animals into the U.S. Endangered species 
are supposed to be monitored by the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service (FWS), but smugglers find 
ways around inspections. Protected species may 
be hidden among legal animals or dangerous species 
of animals so that officers are less likely to 
thoroughly hand-inspect shipments. The FWS 
also suffers from a lack of resources: With the 
number of inspectors, we are able to physically 
inspect 25% of wildlife shipments, says one federal 
wildlife inspector. Penalties for violations 
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) are stipulated by individual countries, 
and the punishments range from short jail sentences 
to fines. People simply pay [the fine] and continue 
to break the law, according to one CITES representative.

Authorities seized a man in June, 1992 who had paid 
$1,000 for a gorilla and $500 for a chimpanzee.  In 
1990, the wholesale price of a pair of young orangutans 
was $15,000.  In 1989, the value of chimps to biomedical 
research was about $25,000.  The monetary stakes are high.
