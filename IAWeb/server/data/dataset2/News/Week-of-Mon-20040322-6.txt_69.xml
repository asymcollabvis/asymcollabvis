A few days before Christmas in 1996, Robert Grajewski saw a tiny brown animal 
sniffing around his mailbox as he pulled out of the driveway on his way to 
work. When he got home that evening a puppy, with no collar or tags, was hiding 
behind a snow shovel leaning on the front porch of his house. She was so small 
Grajewski said he could "see her head sticking out one side and her tail 
wagging on the other." It took just an open door and a kind word to get her 
inside. </content>
