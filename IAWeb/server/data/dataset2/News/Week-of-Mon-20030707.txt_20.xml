WASHINGTON, July 6 — Officials at the National Zoo suspect that a large cat got into a bald eagle’s enclosure and killed the bird, perhaps already weakened by fierce storms and unable to fly. It is the latest in a series of animal deaths at the zoo. The male eagle died Friday morning, the same day that the zoo celebrated a new exhibit designed especially for bald eagles hurt in the wild.
 THE DEAD EAGLE was housed separately from the zoo’s two new eagles that were donated by American Eagle Foundation based at singer Dolly Parton’s Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.
       The 21-year-old eagle, found by a zookeeper early Thursday, had severe puncture wounds to his abdomen and back, spokeswoman Julie Mason said. Zookeepers suspect a large cat crept into the cage and attacked the eagle, who could have been injured during Wednesday night’s fierce rain storms.
