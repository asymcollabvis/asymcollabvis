  <content>Peter Standring, a correspondent/producer for National 
Geographic On Assignment, spent three weeks in and around Nairobi, Kenya, to 
investigate who has been killing Kenya's lions, and why. Watch his report on 
Wednesday, February 11 at 7 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT on the U.S. National Geographic Channel. 
It had been another long, frustrating day at Nairobi National Park in Kenya. 
The sun was setting in a fiery red glow behind the dark profile of the Ngong 
Hills; the light reflected warmly off the flat-topped acacia trees, bringing 
them to life. Beyond, the skyscrapers of downtown Nairobi flickered and 
sparkled. Yet we were glum. We had been in the park since dawn, driving along its maze 
of dirt roads, craning our necks and straining our eyes, searching for lions. 
Exhausted and fed up with our lack of success, we finally put down our 
binoculars and video camera.

goal was to send a clear, strong message to government officials and park 
managers, who, in the farmers' view, had been ignoring their suffering.</content>
