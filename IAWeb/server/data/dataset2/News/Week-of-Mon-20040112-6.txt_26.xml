  <content>Lea Jaunakais' office looks a bit like Animal Planet. 
Her walls, desk and cabinets are adorned with photos of lions, leopards, 
jaguars, pythons and other wild creatures.
But her heart belongs to a striped beast with paws that can reach the size of 
a human head.
"Ever since I was a child, I've had this love and infatuation with tigers," 
said Jaunakais, 27, whose day job is serving as vice president of her family's 
Rock Hill company, Industrial Test Systems.
Her weekends are spent caring for tigers at the Metrolina Zoo in Rowan 
County, N.C., northeast of Charlotte.
She's in charge of three young tigers: Avalon and Brandy, both orange 
Bengals, and Diamond, a white Bengal. Her duties include training and feeding the 
animals and cleaning their cages. She's also helping build a spacious tiger 
enclosure with a waterfall, pool and trees native to the creatures' natural habitat.
"I want to be a major part of the preservation of the tiger," she said. Her 
goal: to let the animals live comfortably in captivity. It pains her to visit 
places where the majestic creatures are cooped up in tiny cages with cement 
floors.
There are fewer than 3,000 wild tigers worldwide, versus almost 12,000 in 
captivity in the United States. Nearly all captive tigers have been bred in 
captivity. It is illegal to capture a wild one. In some poor countries, however, 
people kill tigers to sell their teeth, claws and coat.</content>
