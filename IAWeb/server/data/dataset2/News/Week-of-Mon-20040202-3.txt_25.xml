  <content>he 53-foot trailer shook as the 20 mares inside whinnied and 
stomped, restless and nervous after two days of captivity. Outside the trailer, 
horse lovers peered through the slats in the truck, eager to identify their 
mare.

With a make-shift ramp in place, the back of the trailer noisily creaked in 
the morning stillness as the first frightened-looking mares stepped out. 
"They're like mail-order brides," said Nancy Riegler as she looked for the 
horse she recently adopted off the Internet. "I have looked at her picture so 
many times online that as soon as the truck pulled up and I caught a glimpse of 
her blaze, I knew it was her."

The horses, most of them pregnant, had just traveled 1,800 miles from 
Alberta, Canada, to a ranch in Ramona, the Southern California headquarters of 
FoalQuest.

The mares had all come from farms that supply urine from pregnant mares to 
Wyeth Pharmaceutical, which uses it to manufacture the hormone replacement 
therapy, Premarin.

Since 1999, the nonprofit FoalQuest organization has rescued and found homes 
for foals born to the mares. In October, the group also began finding homes 
for the mares when demand for Premarin dropped and the farms were forced to 
reduce their horse population by 40 percent. About 450 farms in western Canada and 
North Dakota keep as many as 40,000 horses for their urine production.
