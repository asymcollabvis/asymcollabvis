(Los Angeles) A package of beef and a letter from 
"Animal Justice League" claiming that meat had been 
poisoned in 20 Los Angeles supermarkets was left 
at the Los Angeles Times, 1st Street offices. The paper
also received a phone call taking credit for the action 
and stating, "We will take direct action againsts animal
abuse in whatever form is necessary to stop the cruelty." 
A similar threat was made against a supermarket 
in Upsala in November. No poisoned meat was found at
either supermarket.
