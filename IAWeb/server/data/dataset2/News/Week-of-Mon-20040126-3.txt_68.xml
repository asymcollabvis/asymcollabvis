The issue: Vicious dogs
Our view: The city must crack down on dangerous animals on the loose before 
someone gets seriously hurt - or worse.
At what point does a problem need to escalate before somebody does something 
about it?
A Rottweiler attacked a 57-year-old woman last week in a harrowing experience 
that killed her Yorkshire terrier and left her with cuts and scrapes. Janet 
Gale was mauled by the vicious dog when she tried to protect her 7-pound Yorkie 
from its unprovoked aggression.
It took two swings from a neighbor's shovel to get the Rottweiler off a 
terrified, screaming Gale.
Dogs run loose in Freeport neighborhoods all the time. Last September, Pearl 
Brown, who resides on Adams Avenue, jumped inside her door just in time to 
escape a snarling cur that spotted her as it ran up her street. The dog had bit a 
neighbor's son before, she said.
In 2002, Stephenson County Animal Control received reports of 96 dog bites.
Friends Forever Humane Society has had dozens and dozens of large dogs over 
the years, dogs picked up as strays and show the telltale signs of maulings. 
Dogs that have been used to spar with others in illegal dogfights, volunteers 
say. Sometimes they find only carcasses, the remains of dogs torn up by other 
fighting breeds.</content>
