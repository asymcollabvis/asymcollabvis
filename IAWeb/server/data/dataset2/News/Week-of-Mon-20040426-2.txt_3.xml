Gary Yourofsky and Kate Timko, from Royal Oak, Mich., have stopped in
Halifax County for two days to explain the benefits of a vegan lifestyle,
and, what they believe are, the cruel methods used to supply humans with meat.

As vegans, they do not eat anything with a face, a mother or a bowel
movement, or anything that comes from an animal, such as milk, eggs,
cheese and honey. They also don't wear animal skin, such as leather, wool
or fur.

The two are members of ADAPTT, (Animals Deserve Absolute Protection Today
and Tomorrow). They travel to schools and towns all over the country to
spread their message, and stopped at Halifax Community College Monday and
today to speak to students. They will also speak to any members of the
public Thursday at 6 p.m. in room 401, building 400.
