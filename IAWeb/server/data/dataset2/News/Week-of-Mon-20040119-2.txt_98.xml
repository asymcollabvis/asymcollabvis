What is it in the makeup of cats that allows them to take great pleasure in 
teasing, taunting and otherwise just making life miserable and fun at the same 
time for the people who feed them?
I have a blond American shorthair named Maggie. My wife picked out the name, 
not me. I don't believe in giving animals people names, unless it's 
outrageous. Anyway, I retired young and am now a house-husband. So when I do the wash 
and am folding the warm clothes, Maggie plops down on the cleanest, warmest 
article of clothing most likely to show cat hair.
When I read the paper, she will get on the table and plop on the paper right 
where I'm reading. How does she know where I'm reading? I'll try to put the 
paper on the table and read out of the corner of my eye, but it just doesn't 
work.
At 3 a.m. she will sit on my chest and circle my head just to wake me up. She 
will get in my favorite chair about three minutes before I sit in it, and 
then look most indignant when I kick her off, gently, of course. Doesn't she know 
that I make about 20 of her and am much stronger?
Just what is it in the makeup of these wonderful, mysterious creatures that 
they behave like that?
They make me think that they are just human women in fur coats. (Actually I 
love it and would be hurt if she were to stop.) Like they say, "Dogs have 
masters, Cats have house staff." I do believe that to be true.</content>
