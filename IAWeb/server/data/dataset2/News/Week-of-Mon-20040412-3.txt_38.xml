John Burton Wade won't be going back to Mary Washington College this fall.

A judge this week ruled that the freshman can take his exams and finish
the school year--but then it's straight to federal prison.

Wade, 19, of Henrico County, will serve a three-year sentence for his role
in at least 10 environmental terrorist attacks in suburban Richmond in the
summer and fall of 2002.
...
Wade, along with co-conspirators Adam Blackwell and Aaron Linus, left
notes at the scenes of the attacks, claiming they acted on behalf of the
radical environmental group Earth Liberation Front.

But Wade says he wasn't motivated by ELF and doesn't consider himself a
member.

"Writing that at the scene was a convenient way to get our point across,"
he said.

Instead, he says he was inspired by Edward Abbey, author of "The Monkey
Wrench Gang," a book about four nature lovers who wage war on developers.

"It's basically a handbook for environmental terrorism," Wade said.</content>
