Ben Cohen, ice cream maven and TrueMajority founder, answers readers'
questions 
...
How do you feel about the contribution that avoiding animal products
makes to sustainable living, non-support of factory farming, improved
health, alleviation of world hunger, and promotion of non-violence?    
-- Mary Lou Noble, Portland, Ore.

I respect and admire vegans and vegetarians. I personally have not been
able to make such a commitment. I have reduced my consumption of meat,
especially factory-farmed meat -- although I am about to deep-fry 20
free-range turkeys for a fundraiser for the progressive mayor of
Burlington, Vt., Peter Clavelle, who is running for governor.
Contributions can be made here.


How about taking that love for the environment a step further and
offering a line of vegan ice creams? I know a lot of vegans who would be
overjoyed to resume patronizing your establishments, and I would be
first among them!    -- Keegan Roberson, San Francisco, Calif.

Anything is possible. I'm not certain if anything is coming down the
pipeline, but write/email/call the company. Why not organize a group:
Citizens for Ice Cream Choices. I bet the media would love it. Vegans
and those who are lactose-intolerant could show how big of a market they
really are.
