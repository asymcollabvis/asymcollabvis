While visiting Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, 
European Research Commissioner Philippe Busquin is attending today an expert 
seminar on the trends affecting agriculture and food production. Agro-food 
research today has to respond to challenges, such as agriculture policy reform, 
enlargement of the European Union, international trade issues, new technologies 
and rapidly evolving consumer attitudes. On this occasion three major new 
projects are being launched in the agro-food area that the EU is to support with 
research funds totalling ?43 million through the Sixth Research Framework 
Programme (FP6). The projects launched are the first major FP6 activities which 
take the "farm-to-fork" approach. SAFE FOODS is an integrated project on risk 
analysis in food safety, which aims to improve consumer protection, NuGO is a 
network of excellence to integrate genomics, nutrition and health, and WELFARE 
QUALITY is an integrated project on animal welfare and food production (see 
annex). 
"Meeting consumers' expectations for good and safe food, while at the same 
time ensuring sustainable agriculture and fostering a competitive industry, 
requires ambitious R&amp;D efforts and strong cooperation at European level. Consumers 
increasingly demand to know where their food comes from and what it brings 
them. That is why we develop in the EU Sixth Research Framework Programme a new 
"farm to fork" approach, which opens new perspectives for producing food that 
responds to environmental, health and competitiveness objectives,"said 
Research Commissioner Busquin.</content>
