What Do You Do When A
A 100-pound mountain lion can kill an 800-pound elk. Keep that in mind the 
next time you go hiking in cougar territory. 
If you are alone and unarmed, and one of these powerful predators attacks you 
-- intent on killing and eating you, rather than merely trying to drive you 
away from its offspring or a previous kill -- the contest likely will be as 
lopsided as if you had waded into traffic to wrestle a pickup truck. Worse, 
actually, because the odds are that you will never even know until the cougar bites 
into the back of your neck. 
Whether such prowess leaves you horrified or reverent depends on your 
attitudes regarding the role of wildlife and nature in a human-dominated world. 
Mountain lions are among the few remaining species on the planet that persist 
in occasionally regarding humans as food -- grizzly bears, sharks, lions, 
tigers and crocodiles pretty much fill out the roster -- and like all big 
predators they test our philosophical boundaries in a way that most creatures do not. </content>
