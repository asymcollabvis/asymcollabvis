DE KALB, Ill. - The cement-floor holding rooms and massive freezers are
nearly ready for the horses, two years after fire destroyed the only horse
slaughtering plant in Illinois and one of only three in the nation to
process the meat for human consumption.

This month, Cavel International Inc. expects its rebuilt plant on the
outskirts of DeKalb to begin moving as many as 100 horses a day to
slaughter and then to European butcher shops. But whether the plant's new
floors ever echo the clatter of hooves could depend on Illinois lawmakers.

The business has gotten caught up in the emotionally charged question of
whether horses should ever go from the paddock to the plate.

"If in their culture they eat the meat, let them get it from France," said
state Sen. John Cullerton, who plans as early as Wednesday to begin
pushing through a bill to outlaw the slaughter of horses in Illinois for
human consumption.

Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, proposed the ban after learning
Belgium-based Cavel planned to restart its DeKalb operations, the only
U.S. plant outside Texas to slaughter horses for human food.
