Scientists say the Barbary macaque monkeys who live on the Rock of Gibraltar 
are a rare population vital to primate research.

But to local tourism officials they have become a nuisance--an aggressive, 
30-pound nuisance with a dangerous taste for chocolate and a flair for theft.

The dispute has pitted the government of Gibraltar--which ordered 27 of the 
monkeys killed this summer--against researchers, who maintain the macaques 
would have returned to the hills if townspeople could resist offering them junk 
food.

Robert Martin, vice president of Chicago's Field Museum, spent eight years 
studying one 60-member macaque group before the summertime cull cut its numbers 
in half. Martin said officials killed the monkeys without calling him or the 
head of the group managing the population.

In protest, Martin has withdrawn from field research on Gibraltar. He is even 
boycotting the macaque conference he organized there this month.

"I give up," said Martin. "There's no point in continuing. They destroyed 
what we were doing."

The government says the monkeys started it. For whatever reason, probably 
overcrowding on top of the Rock, a troop of them scampered down from the hills 
this summer and descended on the small fishing and tourist town of Catalan Bay.

Once there, officials said the macaques were like college students on spring 
break.

Wildlife experts tried to lure them back to their home with a trail of 
cookies and peanuts. They tried to scare them out of town by brandishing blowguns 
used to anesthetize them in the past. Nothing worked for long.</content>
