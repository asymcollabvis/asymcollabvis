State lawmakers have been offered free tickets to see the Ringling Bros.
and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Sunday at Albany's Pepsi Arena, cour- tesy of
the producer of the show, Feld Entertainment Inc.

 If they were around Albany last Friday, they could have seen another free
show, this one meant to demonstrate the cruelty circus animals allegedly
endure. A male and female representative of the group People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, body-painted to look like leopards, crouched
virtually naked inside metal cages across from the Capitol in a cold,
misty rain for an hour.

Kayla Worden, of Asheville, N.C., a 42-year-old actress and model who now
works for PETA, wore only pasties and panties, while 35-year-old Kristo -
he goes by only one name - wore just skimpy briefs.
