  <content>Type in Beef.com rather than Beef.org and Internet surfers
seeking the latest on mad cow disease might think they've entered
alternative cyberspace.

The pro-vegetarian People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals launched
its Beef.com Web site Wednesday, happily noting the similarity to the
National Cattlemen's Beef Association online address.

The Denver-based trade group's site at Beef.org promotes the wholesomeness
of American beef products and insists the mad cow case reported in
Washington state last month is a single, isolated incident.

But mistakenly type in Beef.com and up pops a picture of a
foaming-at-the-mouth cow and the warning, ''It's mad to eat meat.''
...
''The best way to keep your family safe from contaminated meat is to throw
any meat in your freezer into the trash can,'' Friedrich said.

PETA posted its anti-meat and mad cow messages on Beef.com after Michael
Fischer of Troy, Mich., allowed the group to use his domain name.
Friedrich said Fischer, who was out of the country, was seeking $2.5
million for the address, but offered it to PETA for free for a month
because he's sympathetic to the group's cause.
...
In the United States, it's legal to feed cows' blood to cows as well as
sheep and cow parts to pigs and chickens and chickens to one another,
Friedrich said.

''All of this is in violation of the World Health Organization's
recommendations and of the best science aimed at keeping mad animal
diseases out of the meat supply,'' Friedrich said. ''Anything with a brain
can develop a spongy brain.''

PETA illustrates its argument on the Web site with a picture of a
gun-toting chicken with the words, ''If the beef doesn't kill you, I will.''</content>
