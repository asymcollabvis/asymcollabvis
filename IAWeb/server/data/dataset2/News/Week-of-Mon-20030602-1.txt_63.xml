Old men of the sea have all but gone

A decade-long trawl through the archives has revealed just how fast
industrial fishing fleets wipe out large fish

THE world's fisheries are in a far worse state than anyone thought. Great
predatory fish such as shark, marlin, swordfish and tuna that once filled
the seas are much scarcer today, according to a new assessment. Worse,
stocks that are thought to be flourishing may already have been stripped
bare without anyone noticing.
Many of the world's important fisheries have already collapsed. The most
notorious recent example is the cod fishery in the Atlantic off
Newfoundland, where a scientific advisory panel recommended earlier this
month that the Canadian government list Newfoundland's cod as an endangered
species. Now a decade-long trawl through the archives by marine ecologists
has revealed just how fast commercial fishing fleets clear the sea of large
fish.
Populations of these species plummet as soon as big fishing boats arrive,
the researchers found (Nature, vol 423, p 280). They fall by about 80 per
cent within the first 10 or 15 years, but eventually stabilise at around 10
per cent of the original numbers.
