An incurable disease hitting Ohio's cattle, sheep and goat herds will be the 
subject of a March public meeting in Wooster.
Johne's disease -- it has been around for more than 100 years but it's on the 
rise now -- is difficult and expensive to eradicate and can cause large 
production losses. It is now considered a major farm disease problem, especially 
for cattle, say experts at the Ohio State University Extension.
The information meeting will be from 1 to 3:30 p.m. March 10 in the Fisher 
Auditorium at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center.
The meeting, one of six across Ohio, will inform farmers about the disease 
and programs in Ohio for testing and control.
Johne's disease is a chronic bacterial intestinal infection that is caused by 
a germ related to those that cause tuberculosis and leprosy. It strikes 
silently, can affect a large percentage of a herd and can cause production losses, 
premature culling and loss of marketability of breeding stock.
The bacterium that causes the disease can be spread by manure and strikes 
young animals, though symptoms may not manifest themselves for years. It can also 
be spread by dirty udders.</content>
