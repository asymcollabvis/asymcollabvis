People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is intensifying its campaign 
against Columbia. Undaunted by what they see as an unresponsive administration, 
activists from the organization continue to protest what they call "grotesque 
abuses to animals" in laboratories at Columbia. 
The organization has been mobilized against the university since late 2002 
when veterinarian Catherine Dell'Orto came to PETA with descriptions of abuse in 
Columbia's labs.
According to Mary-Beth Sweetland, director of research and investigations at 
PETA, Dell'Orto recently had a meeting with members of an investigative 
committee at the University to address her concerns.
PETA was unsatisfied with the outcome of this meeting. "It was, as far as 
we're concerned, a farce," Sweetland said.
The organization has been busy in the past months trying to bring the issue 
to the attention of alumni, writing letters and sending copies of a videotape 
to the Alumni Regional Offices that shows images of mutilated, caged baboons 
said to be from the Columbia labs.</content>
