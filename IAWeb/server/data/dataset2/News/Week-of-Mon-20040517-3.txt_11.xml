The UK Government has announced a radical change in the way animal
experiments are controlled.

Science minister Lord Sainsbury, outlined proposals to reduce the number
of experiments carried out on animals and to raise standards of welfare in
laboratories.

The initiative will focus on the so-called "three R's" - the replacement,
reduction and refinement of the use of animals in experiments.

There will also be increased funding for alternatives to animal testing
such as computer simulations and experiments on cultured cells.

Do you think animal testing is justified? Can alternatives to animal
testing be found and will they be effective? Send us your views.
