  <content>For thousands of years, the majestic North American buffalo roamed 
freely over the wide-open plains of the Canadian Prairies. 
Today, most of these brown, woolly beasts spend their time grazing on ranches 
- or in the case of Bailey, watching TV in the living room of an Alberta 
family's home. 
Jim and Linda Sautner are the proud owners of Bailey, a nearly 4-year-old 
bison, who has a penchant for spending his time inside the couple's home, about 
20km west of the provincial capital of Edmonton. 
"My wife wouldn't let me bring my german shepherd puppy in the house one day, 
so I got even with her by bringing Bailey in," Jim Sautner said. 
"He's made a mess on the carpet a couple of times, so now we bring out an 
icecream pail whenever he gives us that look." 
The Sautners, who own 270 head of buffalo, have become accustomed to having 
the 725kg beast in their living room staring at the television. 
"He prefers to watch The Nature of Things," said Jim, referring to a Canadian 
nature television series. 
The couple rescued Bailey as a baby, after the calf was abandoned by his 
mother. Along with farm hands, they bottle-fed Bailey with milk on a daily basis 
and the affinity for one another grew rapidly. </content>
