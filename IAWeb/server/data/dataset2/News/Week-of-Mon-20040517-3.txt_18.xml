LIMERICK Animal Welfare are struggling to make ends meet, as the number of 
abused and mistreated animals continue to rise in the city.

Spokesperson for the group, Niamh Allen said that the dogs (pictured 
alongside) were left starving to death in a city housing estate, yet no-one thought of 
contacting the voluntary organisation, until it was too late for one helpless 
pup.

"We got a call from a caring lady who was very concerned about two pups. We 
went straight away but tragically when we got there one of the pups had been 
killed on the road by a car. We managed to rescue her sister who we named Cara. 
She is around ten weeks old and has hardly any hair due to scabies mange. She 
is also extremely malnourished and is full of fleas and worms,? said Ms Allen.

She said that they also rescued a Springer called Georgie in the same area, 
who is only around three years old, but looks years older as he is suffering 
from malnutrition, and he may go blind as his eyes are badly infected with 
scabies mange.

Ms Allen said that everyone loves cute and cuddly pups, but the state of 
these dogs is an example of the daily reality of their work.

She said that they are desperately in need of more funding to start building 
the first phase of their animal sanctuary in KIlfinane, Co Limerick, so that 
they have proper accommodation and facilities to care for these animals.
