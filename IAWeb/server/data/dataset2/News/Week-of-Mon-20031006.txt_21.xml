If the youngsters in your household are under 7 years old, they are usually 
not developmentally suited for puppies 5 months old and under, or toy-sized 
dogs (under 15 pounds) of any age. 
Puppies have ultra sharp "milk teeth'' and toenails and often teethe on or 
scratch children, resulting in unintentional injury to the child. The puppy 
becomes something to be feared rather than loved. 
Toy dogs are fine-boned, touch-sensitive creatures that do not weather rough 
or clumsy handling well. They break relatively easy and are quicker to bite 
than large boned, mellower canines. A medium to large dog over 5 months old is 
usually the safer choice. 
Who will be the dog's primary caretaker? 
Some parents bow to the pressure their children put on them to get a dog. The 
kids promise that they will religiously take care of their soon to be best 
friend, but you cannot saddle a child with total responsibility for the family 
dog or threaten to "get rid of it'' if the child is not providing that care. 
It is not fair to the child or dog.
