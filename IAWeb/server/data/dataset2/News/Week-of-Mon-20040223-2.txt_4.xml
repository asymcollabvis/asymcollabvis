Working tirelessly, four St. Tammany women with a small core of 
behind-the-scene volunteers managed to provide low-cost sterilization of 821 cats and dogs 
in 2003 through the Spay-Neuter Intervention Program, otherwise known as the 
SNIP van. 
The program provides spay and neutering services to pets whose owners 
otherwise could not afford this service and meet income levels according to federal 
guidelines. 



When space is available, the van also provides the service to residents who 
are working to reduce colonies of stray cats and dogs in their community. 
Florence Ordogne of Mandeville, Lisa King of Abita Springs and Jean Northrup 
of Folsom coordinate SNIP visits in their communities as the Southern Animal 
Foundation West St. Tammany Chapter. In Slidell, Vickie Campos coordinates 
visits in Slidell, Pearl River and Lacombe. 
Although the SNIP van recently experienced a management change and is now 
being run entirely by the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals in New Orleans, the only change to north shore coordinators is finding an 
additional $100 per visit to cover the cost of the van. </content>
