ZELLWOOD, Fla.News showed images of "dog body bags" with legs sticking out and 
other animal skeletons too graphic to show located behind Jancy Pet Burial 
Services in Orange County, Fla. 
"It makes you sick to your stomach," Greenbriar Pet Resort spokesman Barry 
Grimm said. "What of these thousands and thousands of animals that are buried in 
that pit? What is it doing to our ground water supply?" 
Jancy Pet Burial Services prides itself as being a dignified final resting 
place for pets, according to the report. However, it now faces allegations of 
improper pet disposal.
