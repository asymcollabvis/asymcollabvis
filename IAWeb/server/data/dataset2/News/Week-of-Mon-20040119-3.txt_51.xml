Students in the health sciences programme have something tasty to offer. 
Their cookbook, cleverly entitled Eat Your Heart Out, contains over two hundred 
recipes, with more than 40 being vegetarian or vegan friendly. 

Their book not only aims to benefit the stomachs of McMaster University's 
students and other community members, but all the profits are to be donated to 
the Victorian Order of Nurses Meals on Wheels. Janet Malowany, a fourth-year 
BHSc student, originally initiated the idea of producing a cookbook specifically 
intended for students. 

"Originally, I just wanted a forum for students to be able to share their 
favourite recipes with each other," said Malowany. "Only a few years ago, I was a 
novice in the kitchen, myself. When I moved away from home to off-campus, I 
vowed not to eat TV dinners or too much macaroni and cheese. Thus, I appreciate 
simple and nutritious meals and wanted to share my favourite recipes and try 
out some new favourites." 

Positive responses from fellow students prompted Malowany and other Health 
Science scholars to publish the recipes. Supported by co-organizers Noranda 
Nyholt, Tara Davies, Jo-Lynn Dickson and Matt Dang, the entirely student-driven 
group created the charity cookbook. </content>
