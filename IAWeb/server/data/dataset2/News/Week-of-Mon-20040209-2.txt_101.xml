A man scheduled to appear in court Friday on felony animal abuse charges 
continued to collect dozens of cats, rabbits and dogs in his Snow Creek area home 
despite a restraining order to stay away from animals. 

A visit Wednesday to a house from which Doug Yates and his wife, Joyce, were 
being evicted revealed they had kept more than a dozen cats and rabbits shut 
into an otherwise empty bedroom, some in cages.

Neighbors estimated there were more than 30 animals in the home. Animal 
activists have recently expressed concern about what they call animal collectors.

In the past two years, several widely reported cases of animal cruelty, 
including problems at facilities operated by the Riverside County Animal Control 
Services, have brought efforts for reform.

At the Yates home on Wednesday, the metal blinds on a front window were 
clawed to shreds in places and through a window streaks of feces were visible on 
the walls and marble floors.

Joyce Yates, who is not charged with any crime, said in a telephone interview 
that she had taken in the animals to save them from being destroyed in local 
shelters. </content>
