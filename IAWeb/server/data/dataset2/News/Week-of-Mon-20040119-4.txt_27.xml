  <content>At the eastern edge of the Bitterroot Mountains, a
craggy range of peaks that defines the border between Idaho and Montana,
is a lab full of skeptics who don't hold with the majority scientific
consensus on mad cow disease.

They are world-class researchers on these kinds of diseases, categorically
called "transmissible spongiform encephalopathies" -- or TSEs.

Some of these diseases have been recognized for a long time, but they
captured wide public attention only when it appeared -- first in Britain
-- that the disease could get passed on to people who eat beef from a cow
with this type of brain infection, which eats holes in the brain.

Americans were reminded of this risk recently after the nation's first
known case of mad cow disease (technically bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE) was identified just before Christmas in Eastern
Washington.

Most of the scientists here at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a branch
of the National Institutes of Health, accept that this kind of
"cross-species" transfer of a TSE can, on rare occasions, take place. They
were some of the first to show it, in fact, in experimental animals.

But try to make any other simple statement of fact about mad cow or
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, and you will encounter a stubborn refusal
to let you move even one step beyond the evidence. 
...
Whether it's a prion that's transmitting the infection, Race said, or some
other unrecognized virus is still unknown. The confusing terminology in
this field fraught with uncertainty, he said, is enough to drive even many
scientists nuts.</content>
