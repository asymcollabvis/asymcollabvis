If a proposed livestock ordinance being touted by a Jefferson County official 
gains steam, the chickens may indeed come home to roost, but probably not in 
the literal sense Commissioner Mary Zemke intends. 
Calling for looser restrictions on the number of livestock allowed at rural 
homes, Zemke's draft code is already stirring up controversy at Crooked River 
Ranch ? and the proposal hasn't even hit the planning commission yet. 
The guidelines target the smaller, one- to two-acre lots that make up roughly 
half of the Crooked River community. The law would increase the number of 
chickens allowed at the residential development to 50 per acre and approve as 
many as eight pigs, llamas, goats or sheep per one- to two-acre property, with 
four more animals allowed for each additional acre. 
The county currently allows up to 10 chickens per acre and prohibits pigs or 
other mid-size animals at Crooked River Ranch, which is governed by tougher 
livestock codes than the rest of Jefferson County. Exceptions are sometimes made 
for youth farm projects or if the animal is being raised for auction at the 
county fair. </content>
