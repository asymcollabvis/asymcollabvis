  <content>The Cat Welfare Society 
of Israel (CWSI) today called on officials of the Israeli government to stop 
the mass killing of feral cats in the Sharon Region north of Tel Aviv. The 
killings are in response to a single case of rabies found in one cat in the area. 
Thousands of feral cats, in addition to owned animals, are at risk of being 
poisoned with Alpha-Chloralose-laced food baits thrown in the streets, or are 
being trapped and then killed. 


"The poisoned cats are dying a slow and agonizing death," said Rivi Mayer, 
CWSI founder. "Dogs and other animals who could eat the poisoned bait are also 
at risk. In addition, people who bring their pets to veterinarians for rabies 
vaccinations are having their pets confiscated if the pets are not previously 
vaccinated or if their rabies booster is overdue. Some pets also have been 
confiscated from their homes." 
The Israeli Government's actions began six weeks ago after one cat was 
identified with the disease, due to an outbreak in foxes in the area. Despite six 
weeks of protests from animal welfare groups and other concerned citizens 
against the mass cat killing, the Government indicated it would continue the 
extermination of the animals for another four and a half months. 
Dr. Elliot Katz, founder of In Defense of Animals (IDA), said, "The mass 
poisoning of these innocent beings is terribly wrong. It is an expedient response 
that stems from ignorance, callousness, fear or even hate. I urge the Israeli 
government to cease this unwarranted mass killing of innocent animals, 
replacing it instead with vaccination and quarantine programs. </content>
