Americans and Western Europeans have had a lock on unsustainable 
over-consumption for decades. But now developing countries are catching up rapidly, to the 
detriment of the environment, health, and happiness, according to the 
Worldwatch Institute in its annual report, State of the World 2004. 
Perfectly timed after the excesses of the holiday season, the report put out 
by the Washington, D.C.-based research organization focuses this year on 
consumerism run amuck. 
Approximately 1.7 billion people worldwide now belong to the "consumer class"?
the group of people characterized by diets of highly processed food, desire 
for bigger houses, more and bigger cars, higher levels of debt, and lifestyles 
devoted to the accumulation of non-essential goods. 
  

 
The world is consuming goods and services at an unsustainable pace, with 
serious consequences for the well-being of people and the planet, reports the 
Worldwatch Institute in its annual report, State of the World 2004. Around 1.7 
billion people worldwide?more than a quarter of humanity?have entered the 
"consumer class," adopting the diets, transportation systems, and lifestyles that 
were limited to the rich nations of Europe, North America, and Japan during most 
of the last century. In China alone, 240 million people have joined the ranks 
of consumers?a number that will soon surpass that in the United States.
