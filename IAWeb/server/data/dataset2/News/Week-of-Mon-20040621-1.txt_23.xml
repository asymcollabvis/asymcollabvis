MIGALOO the white humpback has been declared a whale of special interest to 
ensure safe passage during his annual migration through Queensland waters.

The declaration took effect yesterday. 
"The declaration of special interest means there will be specific viewing 
conditions relating to Migaloo," Environment Minister John Mickel said. 
"People will not be able to drive a boat or jet ski any closer than 500m to 
the whale or fly an aircraft any closer than 2000 feet (610m) without written 
permission. 
"The maximum fine for breaching these conditions is $12, 375." 
Mr Mickel said the Environmental Protection Agency would continue to maintain 
a database of sightings of Migaloo that was set up during the whale's visit 
last year. 
Mr Mickel said Migaloo was injured in a collision with a trimaran off 
Magnetic Island last year and he urged boaties to take care during the whale 
migration season because there was a higher chance of boat strikes. 
Humpback whales are listed as vulnerable in Queensland under the Nature 
Conservation Act. 
All whales and dolphins are protected under the Act.
