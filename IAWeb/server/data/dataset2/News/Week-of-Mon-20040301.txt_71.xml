Uganda wants to sell endangered chimpanzees to China

A proposal by the Ugandan Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife 
and Antiquities to export three chimpazees to China's 
Zhouwang Zoo in Yunnan Province has raised concerns with 
environmental conservationists.

The proposal could lead to fears that Uganda's name as 
a protector of great apes could be tarnished with the 
consequent loss of tourism and donor funding.

A committee set up by the ministry last week met with 
officials of Uganda Wildlife Authority and endorsed the 
deal to export the chimps to China.

Nkiru Manya, executive director of Uganda Animal Protection 
Centre, defended the chimp export project but said animal 
rights activists should raise their concerns with the committee 
which is handling the export project.

If the export project proceeds as planned, the chimps 
will be exported to China in 20XX.
