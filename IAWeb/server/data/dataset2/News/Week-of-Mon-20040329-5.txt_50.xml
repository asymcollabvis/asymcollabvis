As you grip the scalpel in your hand, your palms become sweaty just
thinking about what you're expected to do. Holding your breath, your hand
slits open the belly of the little frog, spilling its insides. The vile
smell nauseates you, and feelings of guilt course through your mind.

Students enrolled in Richard Horvath and John Wibbens' honors biology
courses are expected to do just that in the second semester.

The two teachers insist that dissection is required, but is it really?
Can't we learn without the unnecessary death of a frog?
...
According to the PETA Web site, frogs sold to schools for dissection
aren't always raised specifically for dissection. Even when the frogs are
raised in captivity, frogs must be captured from the wild to restock these
breeding ponds.

A completely independent frog colony has never thrived long without the
introduction of outside frogs. Stealing these frogs from their natural
habitats upsets the ecosystem. Removing the frogs also removes predators
of insects, allowing for easier insect infestations.

The PETA Web site also cites scientists in the United States who have
noted severe declines in frog populations, which they blame on the capture
of these animals for dissection and food as well as environmental problems.</content>
