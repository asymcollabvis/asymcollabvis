For so many of us meat-loving Americans, nothing gets our blood boiling
quite like the antics of the infamous extremist animal rights group, PETA.

Most of us know PETA as People for Ethical Treatment of Animals.
Interestingly, I came across another organization while searching online
that also used this same acronym to describe their coalition: People
Eating Tasty Animals. Their Web site defined itself as a "A resource for
those who enjoy eating meat, wearing fur and leather, hunting, and the
fruits of scientific research."

So why was I researching PETA online, you may ask? Well, every once in
while, these extremists make a headline with their latest campaign that
piques my interest in the same way it's piqued when I smell a funny odor
in my environment and wonder of it's source. I suppose that's what PETA
wants - just to stir things up, make people a bit uncomfortable and see
how many headlines they can make in the process.
...
And here is my solemn vow: once they convince the lions, snakes and bugs
to accept the PETA way of life, I too will take up the PETA flag.

So go ahead PETA, witness to the carnivorous beasts of the world, so that
they may see the light. But you may want to soften your message first, it
will make it easier for Simba to digest.
