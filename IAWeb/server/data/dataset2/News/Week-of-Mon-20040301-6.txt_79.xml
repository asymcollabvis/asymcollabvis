A mosque stands against the background of oil towers placed in the Caspian 
Sea in Baku, Azerbaijan. A five-year-old cooperative project to clean up the 
Caspian has made partners out of feisty competitors Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, 
Turkmenistan and Kazakstan.



Last month, Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakstan declared war 
... on the jellyfish. A particularly voracious species known as Mnemiopsis is 
munching happily on phytoplankton in the Caspian Sea, the building block for 
the sea's valuable fish stocks. As a result, they're wiping out sturgeon and 
every other type of fish. 
None of the five nations wants to see a repeat of what happened a few years 
ago in the Black Sea, when the Mnemiopsis biomass grew larger than the world's 
entire commercial fish catch. 
So the Caspian countries, spurred by their common jellyfish enemy, are 
coordinating under the umbrella of the Caspian Environment Program. A five-year-old 
cooperative project to clean up the Caspian, the CEP has made significant 
headway as well as willing partners out of feisty competitors. 
Environmental problems that cross borders have often raised tensions between 
nations. But a new generation of scholars and activists see in these problems 
an opportunity to bring nations closer together. 
From disputed territory between Peru and Ecuador to the China-Vietnam border, 
hot spots that could trigger war instead have shown potential to bring peace. 
Big political challenges persist, of course. But advocates point to a growing 
body of evidence that shows that working together to save the environment can 
begin to make peaceful neighbors of once-bickering nations. </content>
