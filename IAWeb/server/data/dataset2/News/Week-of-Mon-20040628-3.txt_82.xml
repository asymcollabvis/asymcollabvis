According to new French research reported in le figaro more than 300,000
French cows would have been infected by the agent BSE (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy ) since the 1980's. This contradicts official government
figures of only 923 bovine infections since the dies ease was officially
confirmed present in France in 1991.

These new figures call into question the French government's capacity to
supervise the animal disease and has highlighted weaknesses in the
overall management of the epidemic.

The research has been published in the Review of Veterinary Research, by
Virginia Supervie and Domenica Costagliola, of Inserm.
