Across Iraq and Kuwait, U.S. troops are rescuing beaten, starving and 
homeless dogs, lavishing them with TLC and crediting the mutts with making their long 
months at war bearable, even joyful at times. A common refrain from soldiers 
is that the dogs are the best things that happened to them at war, providing 
as they do an incalculable morale boost for entire units. 
When a mongrel puppy wandered into his tent last fall, one Army sergeant said 
the effect was immediate and jarring. "When I saw him, I smiled. ... I smiled 
so big and I realized that I haven't smiled in 5 months," the sergeant wrote 
on a Web posting from Iraq. 
At least two-dozen soldiers have become so attached to their canine comrades 
that they have wangled a way to bring them back to America, aided by a 
remarkable civilian volunteer effort in the United States, Europe and the Middle East 
that helps with logistics and costs. 
But the military forbids transporting pets from Iraq, and soldiers now report 
the brass is cracking down, calling for the enforcement of "General Order 
One," a long-standing military prohibition against even feeding or caring for 
animals, much less adopting them. Concern for the safety and health of the troops 
is the rationale. 
On top of that, the primary route for spiriting the U.S.-bound animals out of 
Iraq - 10 hours by road across the western Iraqi desert to Jordan- is now 
shut. Worried about health risks, the Jordanian government is refusing to allow 
any more dogs in, even though the animals are there only temporarily, remain 
confined and have clean bills of health.</content>
