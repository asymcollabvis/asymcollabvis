Charles Patterson, author of Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals
and the Holocaust, spoke yesterday at Goldwin Smith Kaufman Auditorium
concerning his book and the contemporary attitudes towards the treatment
of animals.

In an event sponsored by the Cornell Coalition for Animal Defense,
Patterson drew a parallel between the treatment of Jewish prisoners
throughout the Holocaust and the domestication and treatment of animals.
Patterson argued that the degrading means by which people treat animals is
carried over in the practices implemented in human persecution, as seen in
the Holocaust.

Patterson's thesis of his book and lecture is that the way people deal
with animals has colored and shaped how we treat each other. "The way you
treat animals in the backyard permeates your attitude and how you treat
other human beings in the front yard," said Patterson. 
...
Patterson shrugged off objections to his cause saying that anything
involving animal defense and the Holocaust would be controversial.
Instead, Patterson promoted the advancement of animal rights and a
decrease in the slaughtering of animals. In addition, Patterson is an
advocate of organic farming and the adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet.

Regarding the current treatment of animals, Patterson quoted the view held
by scholar Theodore Adorno, saying, "Auschwitz begins wherever someone
looks at a slaughterhouse and thinks: they're only animals." </content>
