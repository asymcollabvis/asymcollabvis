LANESBORO -- Berkshire Mall employee Emily Nichols protested the use of
circus animals at this weekend's big top show and the 17-year-old said
that her job was threatened as a result, a claim mall management
disputes.
...
A hand-made sign that read, "Tigers don't belong in a mall parking lot.
Think before you pay," sat on her dashboard along other smaller signs in
her rear passenger windows.

Nichols said that a mall assistant manager asked her to move her car,
remove the signs, and told her she was placing her job on the line by
having that material in her car. Nichols said the assistant manager also
said the store she worked for could be penalized for her actions.
...
Berkshire Mall General Manager Joseph Scelsi said Nichols' job is not in
jeopardy.

"There is no way [her protesting] would have a bad reflection on her job
or the mall store," he said.
...
Saturday about 20 protestors stood at that location, said Matt Kelly, a
member of Berkshire Advocates for Animals.

Kelly, Nichols and other protestors said they were there to raise
awareness about the use of animals in the circus and their belief that
it is cruel to spend much of a lifetime in a cage.

"We try to make people aware in the community about the treatment and
plight of animal and human issues," Kelly said.
