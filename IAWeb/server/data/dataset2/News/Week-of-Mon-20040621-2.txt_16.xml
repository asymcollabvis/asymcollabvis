Animal rightists lose sponsor ? After massive complaints from hunters and 
anglers, the pet food company Iams has ended a relationship with an anti-hunting 
animal rights organization. 
    In January, hunter advocate U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance alerted outdoorsmen 
that the Iams Co., maker of Iams and Eukanuba pet foods, joined forces with 
the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) as grand national sponsor of the 
Pet Fest America tour. The tour is a series of animal shows developed by 
HSUS. A flood of sportsmen's calls, faxes and letters ensued, and in the end, 
Iams, a division of Proctor and Gamble, discontinued its support of the 
anti-hunters. 
    Iams conceded the feedback it received from sportsmen had a great deal to 
do with its decision to cut ties with the HSUS. 
    "[We] apologize for the frustration that this sponsorship has caused," 
the company wrote in a letter addressed to the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance. 
    According to the sportsmen's group, some of the nation's major consumer 
product and service firms, including General Mills, Accor Economy Lodging, 
Sears and Ace Hardware, ended relationships with HSUS after thousands of sportsmen 
levied strong protests.
