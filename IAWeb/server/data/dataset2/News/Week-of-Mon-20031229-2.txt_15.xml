When Sheldon Rampton and I wrote our 1997 book, "Mad Cow USA: Could the
Nightmare Happen Here?", it received favorable reviews from some
interesting publications such as the Journal of the American Medical
Association, New Scientist, and Chemical &amp; Engineering News. Yet although
the book was released just before the infamous Texas trial of Oprah
Winfrey and her guest Howard Lyman, for the alleged crime of "food
disparagement," the book was ignored by the mainstream media, and even
most left and alternative publications failed to review it.

Apparently many people who never read it at the time bought the official
government and industry spin that mad cow disease was just some hysterical
European food scare, not a deadly human and animal disease that could
emerge in America.
...
... Our activism won us some interesting enemies, such as Richard Berman,
a Republican lobbyist who runs an industry-funded front group that calls
itself The Center for Consumer Freedom. Berman is a darling of the
tobacco, booze, biotech and food industries, and with their funding he
issued an online report depicting us as the ring leaders of a dangerous
conspiracy of vegetarian food terrorists out to destroy the United States
food system. Last week alone he issued two national news releases
attempting to smear us.
...
Our book, "Mad Cow USA," is temporarily unavailable until a paperback copy
is released later in 2004. However, you can get the book in its entirety
for free through the website of our Center for Media &amp; Democracy. Simply
go to www.prwatch.org and click on the cover of "Mad Cow USA." You'll be
taken to www.prwatch.org/books/mcusa.pdf where you can download for free
the entire book ? and read the warnings that went unheeded then, and are
still being ignored by government regulators and industry.
