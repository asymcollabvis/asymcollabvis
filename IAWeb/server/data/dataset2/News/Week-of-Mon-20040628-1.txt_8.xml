Janet Burkley spoke about the events of June 18 and cried.

Burkley is the director of shelter affairs for the Humane Society of
Searcy, and she and the shelter are experiencing a problem: Illegally
dumped animals are overwhelming the already strapped facilities.
...
It is a scene she encounters often, she said, but for 10 days in June
the number of dumps at the shelter astounded even her. And the site of
those abused puppies that night has left its mark.

"People don't know, but it is against the law to dump an animal. It is
listed as cruelty to animals and a person can be fined or put in jail,"
she said. "We are asking everyone that if they know anything about
anyone dumping animals at the shelter to call the authorities and let
them know. We are determined to stop these people."

In fact, the penalty for a conviction of animal cruelty, a misdemeanor,
ranges from a fine of $50-$1000 and or one year in jail or a period of
community service.

The reason dumping an animal is considered cruel is that it means they
can go without food or water and are at risk of being attacked and eaten
by wild animals, Burkley said.

Between June 14-23 nearly two dozen cats and dogs were illegally dumped
at the shelter.
