Win Rice of McDonough has been a hunter since he was a child, and he wants
that tradition to carry on.

That's why he supports the movement to make hunting a right under the
Georgia Constitution.

"It will protect the rights of my kids and the kids of everybody else
who's into this sport," Rice said.
...
The amendment would change the constitution to assert that "the tradition
of hunting and fishing and the taking of fish and wildlife shall be
preserved for the good of the people," according to the House bill.
...
"What are we fixing here? Has there ever been a challenge to this?" said
Rep. Bob Holmes, D-Atlanta.

That's not the only problem Clayton County Humane Society Vice President
Robin Rawls sees with it.

"Hunting is a special interest," Rawls said. "I don't think our
constitution needs to give rights to special interests."
...
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources also supports the amendment,
though they worked with the bills' sponsors to make sure the wording did
not impinge on the department's ability to regulate the sport, DNR
spokeswoman Beth Brown said.

Rawls, who is also a member of the People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals organization, said that like most animal rights advocates she
would like to see hunting made illegal altogether.

"But the reality is, where we live, it probably isn't going to happen,"
Rawls said.

At the same time, Rawls said she thinks the interest in hunting is
declining. She also questions the amendment effort as a way to prevent the
passage of a law that may one day have the support of the majority.
