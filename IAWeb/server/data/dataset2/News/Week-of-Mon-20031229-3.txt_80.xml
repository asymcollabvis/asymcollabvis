We bond easily with deer. They are shy and beautiful, untamed yet docile. 
Deer are graceful denizens of the Western wilderness into which we carve our 
cities. 

Yet few creatures can do more damage to a well-tended landscape. It's no 
surprise, then, that gardeners who discover Bambi in the backyard are usually less 
than charmed. 

Most of the year, foothills neighbors compare notes about what the deer are 
eating this week. By winter, though, when wild food is diminished, hungry deer 
eat almost any plant they can reach, and otherwise gentle people start trading 
recipes for venison. 

They've tried to discourage them. Pitched noisy fits. Sprayed the plants with 
putrid potions. Festooned the garden with bars of soap and bags of human 
hair. Called them hurtful names such as "pigs on stilts" and "rats in high heels." 
The deer invariably run for cover, but they always return. 

After all, it is their neighborhood and, to browsing deer, a cultivated 
garden offers nothing less than haute cuisine.</content>
