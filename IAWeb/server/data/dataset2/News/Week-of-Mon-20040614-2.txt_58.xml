Jack and David Shealy are Florida natives. In 1971, they opened Trail Lakes 
Campgrounds east of Ochopee, Fla. For generations, families have brought their 
children there to experience the wonders of the Florida Everglades. In 
addition to the natural wonders provided by the environment, the campgrounds also 
provide an array of small animals that the children can see, touch, and learn 
about ? up close and personal. 
Three weeks ago, Jack noticed that a few of his goats did not show up at 
feeding time; last week, he learned why. 
Jan Michael Jacobson knew what was happening to the goats. Jan is the 
director of the Everglades Institute, and he is an expert on the Florida panther. He 
arranged with Jack to set up a video camera in hopes of catching the culprit 
in the act. He was successful. 
Jack contacted the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission and asked that the 
panther be removed. They refused, even though the commission had previously 
removed a problem panther from a nearby Indian reservation. The commission 
confirmed that the panther had killed 15 goats and two emus. Jack asked for 
compensation for his loss. They refused, suggesting that Jack's campground was the 
problem, not the panther. 
Two nights after the videoed slaughter, the panther returned and killed five 
ducks, three turkeys, two emus, two goats and one chicken ? while small 
children slept in many of the 100 sites in the 30-acre campground.
