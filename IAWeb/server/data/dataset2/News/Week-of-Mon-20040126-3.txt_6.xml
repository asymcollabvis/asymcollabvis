A PETERHEAD man has cast doubt over alleged sightings of the 'Beast of 
Buchan' claiming such an encounter would be highly unlikely.
David Witts, who is adviser to the Phoenix Exotic Wildlife Association, says 
very few people have seen a live puma under controlled circumstances with 
which to compare such sightings of 'puma-like' cats, although he does give 
credence to the suggestion that large cats could exist almost unnoticed in the Buchan 
countryside. 
Mr Witts says far from being too big to be a dog, leopards, whether 
yellow-orange-tawny or melanistic, average under 100lbs and while loping on relatively 
short legs would appear, if anything, to be smaller than the average Golden 
Retriever.
"Pumas can be much heavier and tend to walk more 'upright' on longer legs. In 
recent times, though, there have been no proven 'black' pumas anywhere in the 
world and the 'scream' of a female puma is perhaps unlikely to go unnoticed 
in rural Buchan," says Mr Witts.
"As to whether such 'large cats' could exist almost unnoticed given 
sufficient food supply, the answer is a qualified 'yes'," he says. 
"Indeed, leopards have long had a reputation for doing so. Such a cat escaped 
within Nairobi city boundaries in the 1950s, causing considerable public 
concern. All attempts to recapture were unsuccessful, although four other leopards 
were obtained in the process, which was news to the local populace." </content>
