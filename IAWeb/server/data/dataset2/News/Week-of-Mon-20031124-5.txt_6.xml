  <content>Stray No More Inc., the only ?no-kill? animal shelter in Cambria, 
Bedford and Somerset counties, will find itself homeless come Monday morning.
And while the nonprofit organization?s leader vows to eventually reopen, 
volunteers are scrambling to quickly find homes for more than 20 pets.
?We?re just desperate at this point,? shelter Director Janet Good said in a 
telephone interview from the shelter, 325 Plank Road. ?I don?t know what I?m 
going to do with these guys if I can?t get them into homes.?
In hopes of placing all 22 cats and two dogs, the shelter ? beside BiLo 
market in Laurel View Plaza ? will be open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. today and 
tomorrow.
Stray No More?s phone number is (814) 443-3776. The shelter charges a $75 fee 
for adoptions, both for cats and dogs.
By 8 a.m. Monday, Good said the agency must vacate the small storefront it 
has called home for 13 months because of dwindling finances.
Rent runs from $1,400 to $1,800 per month, she said.
?We just can?t afford it,? Good said. ?The only money we get is donations 
and adoption fees.?</content>
