At Darley Oaks farm in the Staffordshire village of Newchurch, Chris Hall has 
bred guinea pigs for use in animal experiments for more than 30 years. It may 
come as no surprise, then, that he has been targeted by local animal rights 
activists, who claim not only that the guinea pigs are housed in appalling 
conditions but who are also resolutely against the use of animals in research 
anyway. 
But what started as regular peaceful demonstrations outside the farm four 
years ago has escalated into violence and intimidation against the Hall family 
and many of their associates. Police said that that there has been a string of 
criminal activity - from vandalism to arson - in the name of a campaign that is 
rapidly becoming the new front line in the UK's animal rights movement. 
"The shift has moved from peaceful protest towards this more criminal way of 
protesting," says Inspector David Bird of the Staffordshire police force. Last 
week, one of the Halls' unused houses was the target of an arson attack 
believed by police to be the work of local activists. 
The Halls have never spoken publicly about the activists, and would not speak 
to the Guardian about the latest events. The campaign against them, however, 
has been recorded in detail on a web site run by Save the Newchurch Guinea 
Pigs (SNGP), which has protested outside the farm every week for the last four 
years. 
The site talks proudly about the group's past marches and protests and even 
publishes contact details for the Hall family, encouraging members of the 
public to call the farmer with their comments on his work. "At one point they [the 
Halls] complained that they were getting up to 400 phone calls a day from 
people who care about animals!" says the site.
