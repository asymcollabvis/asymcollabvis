peacefully on Thursday, Nov. 27, 2003, in the Village of Haliburton, ON, and
in the presence of his wife, Sharon.? He was eighty two.? The 27th of
November also marked the 30th anniversary of his proposal to Sharon, as well
as his daughter?s birthday.? In his last moments, Ron listened to a
recording of wolf calls, finding comfort in the sounds of the animals he
loved throughout his life.?
