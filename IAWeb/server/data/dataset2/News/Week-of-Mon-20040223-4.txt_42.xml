 Long before Steve Hindi became known as an animal protector, he was known
as an animal killer.

He had the ultimate fish tale: He caught a 71/2-foot-long, 230-pound Mako
shark.

His story spread quickly, courtesy of a write-up in the New York Daily News.

He caught it in a boat smaller than the fish itself, wrestling his way to
fame off the coast of Long Island during five trying hours in 1985.

But the attention he received from that one fight would be nothing in
comparison to the hundreds of press accounts that would focus on Hindi in
the years to come.

Those closely involved in the polarizing animal rights debate disagree on
everything about Hindi - from whether his tactics are effective to whether
his statistics are accurate.

But no matter what they think of Hindi, they can't help but think of him
because he keeps popping up.
...
While many animal rights groups rely on traditionally influential
techniques - most notably finding strength in numbers - Hindi's fight has
mirrored his "Old Man in the Sea" tale.

A lone man in a small boat, he fights desperately against a force far
stronger than himself. His usual method of attack takes him around the
country to covertly shoot video of animal abuses and then broadcast those
videos on a specially equipped truck that now has 100-inch screens.

That struggle has taken its toll, most noticeably by breaking up his marriage.
...
But Hindi insists that using violence is just as bad as abusing animals, a
much different view than some animal rights groups, like the Animal
Liberation Front.

"The biggest lie told by a component of our side is that we have the right
to use violence because they use violence," Hindi said.</content>
