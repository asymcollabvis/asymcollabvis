  <content>Big, white, fluffy Great Pyrenees dogs are called "Gentle 
Giants." Three-year-old Charlie is one of them. 
Last week, the formerly emaciated dog became the house companion for 
Edenbrook of Plano, an assisted-living center. He was placed by SPIN, a rescue group 
called Saving Pyrs in Need. 
President Cindy Tuttle says SPIN formed last November to deal with the 
growing number of abandoned or mistreated Pyrs in North and East Texas. People often 
misjudge their abilities to care for such a big critter. It arrives as a 
small, fluffy puppy, but can grow to be 130 pounds. Not a lap dog. 
Charlie is SPIN's first assisted-living-center dog. The SPINsters are happy 
to place any of their 20 rescued dogs in other homes, too.  
Edenbrook executive director Debra Denney says Sunrise Senior Living acquired 
the facility last fall and "requires its communities to have a dog." She 
found an ad in The Dallas Morning News classifieds for Petfinder (www.pet 
finder.com) and posted a "dog needed" notice. SPIN responded. 
As it turns out, the Great Pyrenees is the right size. Residents don't have 
to bend over to pet him, and he's the right height to greet someone in a 
wheelchair. He's practically perfect ? and he has 65 residents and 65 staffers 
looking out for his well-being. </content>
