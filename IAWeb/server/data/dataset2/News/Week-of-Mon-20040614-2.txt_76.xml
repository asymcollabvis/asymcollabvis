Ron Gillett has amassed stacks and stacks of documents, newspaper clippings, 
bumper stickers and e-mail printouts in his crusade to remove wolves from 
Idaho.
Wolves and elk
Here's a sampling of what biologists know about wolves and elk:
? Elk and wolves evolved together, but both face changed conditions because 
of humans.
? The number of elk counted in northern Yellowstone has dropped from 19,359 
in 1994 to 8,355 in December 2003. In the 1960s, rangers killed elk to keep the 
herd at about 3,500. The reduction of elk has increased vegetation such as 
aspen trees in the park.
? The critical calf-cow ratio has shown a significant drop in Yellowstone and 
Jackson Hole, but biologists aren't sure wolves are the sole cause.
? In central Idaho, calf-cow ratio trends are mixed, with a decline in the 
Middle Fork of the Salmon River area but increases in portions of the Clearwater 
country in north-central Idaho since the 1990s.
? Wildlife managers in Canada and Alaska, where wolf populations are strong, 
regularly manage game herds by increasing hunting seasons, or even hiring 
hunters to kill wolves so that big game numbers rebound faster.
