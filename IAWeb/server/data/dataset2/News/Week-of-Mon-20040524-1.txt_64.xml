Battery Cage protests planned at supermarkets 
Animal rights activists have begun a new phase in the campaign to ban the 
battery cage. The Campaign Against Factory Farming is asking Wellington 
supermarkets not to stock eggs produced on battery farms. 
CAFF has written to every supermarket in the Wellington area, asking them to 
stop selling cruelly produced battery eggs, and activists plan to personally 
visit every supermarket in Wellington over the next few months 
On Saturday June 5th, CAFF supporters will be protesting outside New World 
Supermarket in Wakefield St. 
CAFF spokesperson Arthur Price said most New Zealanders agree that battery 
cages should be banned, but the government had failed to act. "2.8 million New 
Zealand hens continue to suffer in appalling conditions. An opinion poll showed 
78% of New Zealanders are opposed to battery cage cruelty and want the 
battery cage abolished. We want supermarkets to respond to public demand and refuse 
to stock cruelly produced products". 
"We are demanding that supermarkets immediately stop selling eggs from 
Mainland Poultry which is New Zealands biggest battery egg producer. We also want 
supermarkets to stop confusing customers with misleading labelling such as "Farm 
Fresh" and instead use labels stating "Battery Cage Eggs".
