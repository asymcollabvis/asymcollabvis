  <content>It's been a couple of decades since I sat in a Berkeley
auditorium listening to Timothy Leary, the 1960s drug guru and
revolutionary, rail about the decline of American culture. But one of his
observations has remained especially fresh in my memory. He was talking
about George Orwell's dystopian classic, "1984," in which every home had a
"telescreen," a sort of television monitor through which Big Brother could
watch people in their homes.

"As it turns out, things are even worse than Orwell predicted," Leary
ranted. "Yes, there's a screen in every house. But people are just sitting
around staring at it."

Leary's lament came to mind again the other day when I learned that the
Food and Drug Administration was considering giving biotechnology
companies the green light to sell meat and milk from cloned animals. Like
many kids who grew up in the 1950s, I read lots of science fiction books
about future societies in which people no longer sat down to eat real food
but got all their nutrition from a pill - futures that struck me as sadly
devoid of the rich cultural fabric of meal time, sociality and family.
...
And I realize that, while I do participate in today's animal economy, I
and most people I know are less sanguine about the trajectory of meat
production than we used to be. I realize that, while I do not know what
"animal rights" really means, I do see in many animals a familiar sense of
self-awareness that lately seems deserving of more, rather than less,
sympathy and respect. And I realize that what bothers me most about the
prospect of a new and burgeoning market in replicated animals is that it
represents a move completely counter to the way I wish things were going
with regard to the relationship between us and our phylogenetic cousins.
