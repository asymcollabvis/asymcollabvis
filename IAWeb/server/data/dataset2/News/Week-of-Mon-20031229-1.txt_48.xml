If you really want to understand mad cow disease, just think of sex and
AIDS, the eternity of nuclear waste and playing the lottery.

Now add a hamburger patty to the mix, and grind it all together.

Want to take a bite out of that?

I understand if you don't. So why don't we hear many government or
beef-industry officials talking candidly about what's really at play with
the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States?

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is spinning so hard on how mad
cow won't touch you, it's clear the agency is more concerned with the beef
industry than it is in your well being. 
...
My wife works for PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and
is considered the resident mad cow expert there.

She's been warning me about mad cow for years.

Fortunately, I became a vegetarian when we got married years ago, so I
don't have to deal with an "I told you so." 
...
The whole thing is timed perfectly to help you ring in the new year with a
real 2004 resolution: Go vegetarian! (You haven't heard of mad carrot
disease, have you?)

What cholesterol and heart disease haven't done to push you over the top,
perhaps mad cow will.

At least, get to know your meat with the same precaution you use with a
potential sex partner.

Eating meat can be just as deadly as sex. And it's definitely more fattening.
