There are as many ways to count the number of sport hunters in America as 
there are people doing the counting, and they are producing some widely different 
results. 
Regardless of the method used to count them, one trend shows up time after 
time - sport hunters in America are a vanishing breed. 
The National Opinion Reseach Center, for example, has reported a decline of 
hunting of nearly 12 percent from 1990 to 2000. Many informed observers would 
agree with T.A. Heberlein, an authority on the demographics of sport hunting, 
that, "If these trends continue, hunting as we know it will not exist by 2050." 
The reasons are obvious - loss of habitat for wildlife because of both 
urbanization and increasingly destructive land management practices, the changing 
demographics of our population, changing lifestyles in our society, and a 
growing propaganda campaign about killing animals for pleasure. 
If the reasons for the decline of sport hunting are so obvious, the most 
practical approach to reversing it is just as obvious. It is an attitude of faith 
among hunters, and widely supported by research, that people who do not begin 
hunting by the time they are in their late teens, will never hunt.</content>
