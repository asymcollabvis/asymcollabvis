New York's highest court has indicated that other states may be barking up 
the wrong tree when they make it easier for dog-bite victims to sue owners of 
pets without a rap sheet.

Last week, the Court of Appeals rejected a suit brought against a dog owner 
whose pet bit a 12-year-old boy. The court relied on 188 years of New York 
state law, even as other states put more responsibility on pet owners.

On Dec. 31, 1998, Matthew Collier was at the home of Charles and Mary Zambito 
in Auburn, visiting the Zambitos' son, Daniel.

When Collier went downstairs, the Zambitos' dog Cecil, a 
beagle-collie-rottweiler mix, barked at the boy. Mary Zambito placed the dog on a leash and 
encouraged Collier to allow the dog to sniff his hand, as the dog had known him from 
prior visits, according to court papers.

Cecil lunged at the boy and bit him on the face. Collier required medical 
attention and was left with a 1.25-inch V-shaped scar near his mouth, the court 
documents said.

But according to legal papers, the dog had never attacked or threatened 
anyone before.

Still, Andrea Collier, Matthew Collier's mother, argued that the dog's 
behavior of barking and running, as well as the Zambitos' practice of keeping Cecil 
in the kitchen, away from visitors, should have been evidence enough the dog 
was capable of attacking.

The Colliers argued the case should go to trial.

In a 4-to-2 vote, the high court disagreed, keeping with New York precedent 
that an animal has to have shown a previous tendency for violence for the 
owners to be held responsible for an attack.</content>
