  FWS ISSUES ADVISORY ON CATFISH IMPORTS INTO FLORIDA
  
  The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is warning ornamental 
  fish merchants not to handle any shipments of tropical 
  catfish from South America that may have come into the 
  United States through  Miami, as the packaging bags may be 
  contaminated with a substance that can cause serious illness. 
  The source of the toxin is unknown, but it is not directly 
  related to the imported fish themselves. The symptoms of 
  this toxin are predominately neurological when the packaging 
  has been handled: tingling of the hands, dialated eyes, 
  breathing difficulty and possibly euphoria.
  
  The FWS has recently learned from the Florida Department 
  of Health that three Florida fish retailers have had employees 
  become ill from handling the catfish containers.
  
  The FWS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 
  the states of Florida continue 
  to investigate this situation. While not explicitly identified 
  as responsible for the affected shipments, a list of ten 
  tropical fish import/export businesses of interest, with recent 
  catish shipments from South America, has been circulated:  
  Alberto Salazar Import Export, Aquatic Treasures, Ed Parker 
  Tropical Fish, Global Ways, Imperial Tropical Fish Farm, LB 
  Brandow Tropical Fish, Oceans Reefs and Aquariums, Odd Ball 
  Aquatics, Sanchez Brothers Tropical Fish, and Tidwell Fish Farm.
