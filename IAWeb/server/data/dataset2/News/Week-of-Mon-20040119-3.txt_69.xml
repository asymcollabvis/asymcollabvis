 An Orchard Street man was charged Jan. 13 with animal cruelty after 
allegedly leaving his dog outside in sub-zero temperatures.

Jose A. Burgos, 43, of 34 Orchard St., received a misdemeanor summons for the 
alleged mistreatment of the dog.

Officers went to Orchard Street on a complaint of a dog chained outside the 
house.

Police said the officers observed that the dog ? a white boxer named Scooby ? 
had bones showing through his skin, open sores and was very dirty. 

Police spoke to neighbors who confirmed that the dog was always outside, even 
in frigid weather, with very little shelter, according to reports.

Animal Control arrived at the scene, and the dog was brought to a shelter. 

A NORWALK man was charged Jan. 17 with interfering with police after 
allegedly yelling at officers when he was pulled over on a motor vehicle stop.
