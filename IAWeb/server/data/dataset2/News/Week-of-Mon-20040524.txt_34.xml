Please join us for a discussion with inspiring activist and educator
Pattrice Le-Muire Jones.  On today's program we'll be addressing some
difficult challenges currently facing the animal liberation movement. 
For example, how do we make sense of the lack of diversity within the
movement? What does coalition-building actually mean and what does it 
look like in practice?  We'll also be tackling some interesting ideas,
including connections between queer issues and animal issues, and
relationships between animal liberation and the Iraq prisoner abuse
scandal. Pattrice will also share with us her experience of running a
chicken santuary, in the historical heart of the poultry industry.

Pattrice's bio:

At the Eastern Shore Sanctuary and Education Center, pattrice jones 
cares for chickens while promoting agriculture reform in a rural region
dominated by the poultry industry. Jones also coordinates the Global
Hunger Alliance, which unites animal, environmental, and social justice
organizations to promote plant-based solutions to the worldwide hunger 
and water crises. She has spoken up for animals in venues as diverse as the World Food Summit in Rome, the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, and the Sustainable Development Conference in Islamabad. An activist since 15, when she gave up meat and joined the gay liberation movement, Jones has organized organized rent strikes, kiss-ins, street theatre, and extremely unlikely coalitions. A founding member of Global Boycott for Peace, Jones agitates for direct economic action against war in the same spirit that she advocates veganism.
