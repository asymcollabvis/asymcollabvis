  <content>Rep. Richard Gephardt has been searching for just the right issue to bring
down his arch-rival in the Democratic presidential race, Howard Dean. First,
he criticized the former Vermont governor for trying to cut Medicare,
welfare benefits, and aid to the elderly and blind. Then he hit Dean for his
alleged lack of foreign policy experience.
But wait until Gephardt rolls out the "leg-trap" issue, bashing Dean for his
support for the contraptions used to hunt animals. At a breakfast with
reporters earlier this month, Steve Murphy, Gephardt's campaign manager,
described the leg-trap issue as a potent political weapon that could cripple
(pun intended) Dean in California and New York, where apparently the
campaign believes the animal-rights vote is strong.
"It's been a huge issue in a number of states," Murphy said. "And obviously
it's a visually compelling issue," he added, hinting at an ad campaign
featuring helpless furry creatures caught in the jaws of traps.
