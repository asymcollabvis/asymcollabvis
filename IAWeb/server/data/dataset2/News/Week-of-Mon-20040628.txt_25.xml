Opponents of Alberta's annual spring grizzly bear hunt say they're relieved 
only six bears were killed this year but plan to continue lobbying for an 
end to the harvest over concerns the province's grizzly population is 
dwindling.

"It's bad news for those six bears, but it is good news because we were 
bracing ourselves for a lot more to be killed," said Stephen Legault, 
executive director of the Canmore environmental group WildCanada.net.

"I'd be even happier if it was zero, and I'm hoping that given the public 
concern expressed about the grizzly hunt over the last six months that 
ending the hunt next year is a real possibility."

Alberta wildlife officials said Friday that four male and two female 
grizzly bears were harvested by hunters during the six-week season that ran 
from April 1 to May 15 in most areas of the province.

The number of successful hunts is down substantially from previous years, 
including last year's hunt, which saw 18 bears taken by hunters.

Officials said the 2004 hunt is considered a success because only two 
females were killed.
