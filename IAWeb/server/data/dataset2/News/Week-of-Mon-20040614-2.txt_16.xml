Shark-hit Shell swims 4000 miles
By Cara Page

A TOUGH turtle swam 4000 miles to Scotland despite having one of her flippers 
bitten off by a shark.
The lost loggerhead, nicknamed Shell, was left floundering in circles in the 
Caribbean Sea after the shark attack reduced her to three flippers.
Experts believe she managed to slip into the Gulf Stream but was swept into 
the chilly Atlantic, leaving her weak, exhausted and nearly dead.
She was washed up4000miles from home on a beach in North Uist in the Outer 
Hebrides where she was found by a couple of tourists out for a walk.
