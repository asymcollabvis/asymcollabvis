Fido and Fifi can join the wellness boom at a clinic offering inexpensive 
animal health checkups. 
PetLuv, the county's nonprofit spay and neuter center, will open today a 
comprehensive wellness clinic for dogs and cats at its 7348 Broad St. location in 
Brooksville.
The clinic will offer the new service to all pet owners, but the elderly, who 
often cannot afford regular veterinarian visits, will benefit the most, 
supporters say. 
"The vets are going to vilify us for us doing this full-service work but 
we're not trying to take any business away from them," said Richard Silvani, who 
opened the clinic in 1997. "We're expanding because there's need."
"A huge number of people out there are priced out of the market and can't 
afford veterinary care," said Silvani, a retired Air Force colonel. "If they walk 
into a vet's office, they'll walk out $150 poorer." 
PetLuv's $15 office exam by a licensed veterinarian will include a checkup of 
heart, lungs, teeth, eyes and ears. Any other treatment would be extra, 
according to Silvani. The exams will be held Tuesdays by appointment only. 
"We're not out to make money; we're going to price the exams as low as 
possible because we're a nonprofit group," he added.</content>
