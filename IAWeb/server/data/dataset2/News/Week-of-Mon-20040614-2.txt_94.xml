MINNEAPOLIS - Cherie Englund has been an organic shopper for more than
three years, after concluding that an organic diet helped ease the
chronic health problems of her 7-year-old son, Jon.

So the Oakdale mother shops at the River Market Community Co-op in
Stillwater.

"I'm convinced that organic is the way to go," Englund said. "If (Jon)
is feeling better, he does better in school. And it's just easier to
live in the house when the kids are doing well."

Shoppers like Englund have put organic and natural foods solidly in the
mainstream. One of every 10 U.S. food dollars now is spent on organic
and natural foods, accounting for about $43 billion of the nation's
overall food spending of $433 billion. That's up 72 percent over the
last five years.

With consumers concerned about everything from mad cow disease to
genetically modified food, analysts say organic and natural foods are
only beginning their growth.
...
Local activist and entrepreneur Michael Martin is launching a nationwide
caravan this year to promote organic foods. ONE, the Organic Natural
Experience, is sponsored by a half-dozen organic heavyweights, including
Annie's Pasta, the Clif Bar and Odwalla juices.

Martin's company, Music Matters, made its name promoting concerts for
the environment. Martin got interested in organic food after surviving a
bout with bladder cancer, which he blames on childhood exposure to farm
chemicals.

The ONE caravan will cross the country from Boston to Seattle and points
in between, including a stop in Minneapolis. But Martin said the plan
calls for a focus on places not normally known as hotbeds of organic
activity.

"We're not trying to go to the extreme green places," he said. "Joe
Sixpack needs to understand that it's not about lentils, it's not about
hippies anymore."
