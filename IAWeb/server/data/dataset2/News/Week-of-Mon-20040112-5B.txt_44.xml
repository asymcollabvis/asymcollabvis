  <content>When we lived in Japan, they had this delicacy called fugu ? puffer fish.
Only a licensed chef could make this dish, because a slip of the knife
rendered it more toxic than cyanide. If it?s prepared correctly, diners
feel euphoric after eating fugu. If not, diners get dizzy, their mouths
tingle, they can?t breathe and then they die.

Dangerous. But people still ate it. I didn?t. But other people did. 
...
On Dec. 23, one American cow tested positive for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy ? mad cow disease. The USDA recalled the entire day?s meat
production from that company. Eating meat from mad cows may cause humans
to develop an illness that causes depression, psychosis and immobility
before death.

Scary. But people still ate it. I didn?t. But other people 
 

Wait a minute.

Let?s think about this. 
...
Because I?m not likely to give up my burger any time soon ? even if it is
poisonous. I?m likely to take up living on the edge. Likely to start
making my own ground chuck. Likely to start up a dangerous little
Hamburger Club on the edge of town ? with hot jazz seeping into the alley.
One where you?d have to recite the ingredients of a Big Mac to get in.

With my new, edgy, illegal, burger-driven lifestyle, I?m likely to be
deported to a country where they don?t even have the USDA. Just for spite,
I?ll set up an Americatown for expatriated burger-eating Americans.
Patrons will sit at stools made of pickle tubs. Old Glory will swathe the
walls. Little tubs of cholesterol will burn in dishes on the table. And
the people of the world will come a-knockin? at my door.
