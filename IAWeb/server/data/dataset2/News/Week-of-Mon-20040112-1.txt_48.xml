  <content>A small black and white terrier mix spent five days caged up outdoors in 20 
and 30 degree weather at the Park Hills pound with a dozen other dogs.
The full-grown dog with no name would have been put to sleep in a couple more 
days if Diana Blackwell of the St. Francois Society hadn't picked her out of 
the bunch of dogs there.
The animals there have just seven days at the Park Hills pound before they 
are put to sleep by a veterinarian. But some pounds in the area give animals 
even less time than that.
Blackwell rescued the dog from the pound Monday and gave her a temporary home 
with Tamara Madison of Park Hills.
Madison, like 12 others in St. Francois County, is a foster parent for 
animals who have been saved by Blackwell and will be taken up to PetsMart stores in 
St. Louis for adoption.
Blackwell, and a few volunteers like her, rescue stray animals from pounds 
and off the streets where the animals would eventually die.</content>
