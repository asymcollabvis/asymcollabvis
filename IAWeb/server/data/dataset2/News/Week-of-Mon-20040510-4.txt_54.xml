VANCOUVER, B.C. - A Canadian immigration panel is considering whether
accused environmental saboteur Tre Arrow can apply for refugee status in
Canada.

Arrow, 30, who is wanted for fire bombing logging and cement trucks in
Oregon, asked the Canadian authorities to remain in Canada as a political
refugee at a hearing in Vancouver on Tuesday.

A key issue will be whether Arrow is affiliated with a terrorist group,
which would immediately disqualify him from receiving refugee status in
Canada, authorities said.
