The biotechnology industry has called on President George W. Bush to help 
combat "a growing wave of terrorist" violence from animal rights activists. 

In a letter to President Bush, Biotechnology Industry Organization President 
Carl Feldbaum highlighted the industry's concerns over the changing tenor of 
animal rights activism and called for government action. 
"Animal rights terrorists have engaged in bombings of research facilities, 
harassment of the children of biotech executives in their schools, and vandalism 
of personal property," wrote Feldbaum. "Their campaign against biotechnology 
companies is strategic, specific, unrelenting and directed toward delivering 
economic, and sometimes physical, damage to companies engaged in innovation for 
life-threatening diseases such as cancer and cystic fibrosis." 
In August, Emeryville-based Chiron Corp. was the target of two bomb blasts. A 
month later, Pleasanton-based Shaklee Inc. was the victim of a third. No one 
was injured in the attacks, and there was only minor damage to property. 
Chiron and Shaklee's parent, the Japan-based Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. 
have both in the past contracted for animal testing with Huntingdon Life 
Sciences, the subject of an ongoing campaign by animal rights activists hoping to 
drive it out of business. </content>
