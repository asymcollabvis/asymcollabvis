Vegan and macrobiotic diets have led to the return of rickets in Britain,
according to experts. They say cases among children are rising, more than
50 years after the disease was virtually eradicated by better health and
nutrition.

Doctors have blamed a variety of factors, including the fact that children
are failing to get enough vitamin D, either because they are fed too much
junk food or are on vegan and macrobiotic diets which ban dairy products.
Fears over skin cancer mean that children are not being exposed to enough
direct sunlight, another source of vitamin D. Children who are left in
daycare facilities for long periods, where they spend most of the time
indoors, may also be more vulnerable.

Brian Wharton, an adviser to the Government and the World Health
Organisation on child nutrition, highlighted the return of rickets in a
paper published in the medical journal The Lancet. He said: "An old
problem of nutritional child health, once thought vanquished, has resurfaced."

There are an estimated 250,000 vegans in Britain, and increasing numbers
of people are following the type of macrobiotic diet favoured by
celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna. One in 10 teenaged girls
are vegetarian or vegan, according to the Food Standards Agency.

Earlier this year, a New York couple were convicted of endangering the
life of their 15-month-old daughter by subjecting her to a strict vegan
diet which left her malnourished and suffering from rickets. Silva Swinton
and her husband Joseph were jailed after what was seen as a test case for
parents who put their children on such diets.

A spokesman for The Vegan Society said: "Being vegan is a health and a
moral choice, and a vegan diet can be followed without suffering from
vitamin loss."
