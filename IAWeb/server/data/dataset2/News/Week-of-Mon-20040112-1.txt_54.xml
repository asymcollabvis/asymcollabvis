  <content>PERIODICALLY, some form of cheating rises to the surface to blemish the sport 
of horse racing. Few methods have been as blatantly abusive to the horse as 
blood doping with epoetin alfa, a synthetic form of the body?s natural 
erythropoietin, which can be fatal when given to a healthy horse. Epoetin alfa is 
considered a life-saving drug for humans with severe anemia and is better known by 
the trademarks Epogen and Procrit. 
Natural erythropoietin is a protein produced by the kidneys that circulates 
through the bloodstream to the bone marrow, where it stimulates production of 
red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. 
Muscles require oxygen to function properly. When muscles are used to such an 
extent that the cardiovascular system cannot keep up with the needed supply 
of oxygen, a waste product, lactic acid, is produced that causes muscle 
fatigue-the burning you feel when a muscle tires. The greater the amount of 
circulating red blood cells in the body, the greater is the body?s capacity to deliver 
the needed oxygen; therefore, as long as the oxygen supply is able to keep up 
with oxygen demand, muscles do not tire. </content>
