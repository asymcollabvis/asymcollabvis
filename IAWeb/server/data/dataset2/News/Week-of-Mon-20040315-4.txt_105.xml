NEW YORK - Martha Stewart may be a felon, but in what's left of this city's 
long-suffering Fur District, she was a hero. By early last week, furrier Larry 
Cowit had heard from not one but two customers who "had to have" that luxe 
scarf Stewart was wearing after she got the bad news.

Was that chinchilla or rex rabbit framing Martha's sober mug splashed all 
over television?

"There's a silver lining in every bit of bad news," said Cowit.

Martha's lining, it turns out, was dyed chinchilla, and the silver will be 
going to Cowit and his brother, Steve, the third generation to run Henry Cowit 
Inc. He estimated he'd charge less than $2,000 a scarf.

After two dreadful decades - years of watching their friends go bust or 
retire to Florida - the Manhattan furriers are happy to revel in a few good turns 
of events: Finally, last year, national retail sales in fur bounced back to 
1984's $1.8 billion high. Finally, winter back East is bitter again. Finally, the 
paint throwers with ethical objections to wearing anything that once had a 
mother are widening their scope to target animal-research labs, taking heat off 
furriers.

And most important, finally, the fur is, yes, flying again on the runways. 
From Paris to New York this spring, designers who could barely afford to put on 
shows were trimming their fall suits to sports clothes in dyed everything - 
rabbit, lamb, pony and, of course, chinchilla.

So guys like Larry and Steve Cowit can maybe take it easier during summer. 
And play a little golf.</content>
