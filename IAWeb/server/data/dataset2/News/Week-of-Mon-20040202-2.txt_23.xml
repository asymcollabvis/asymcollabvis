  <content>Humane officers seized 31 dogs from another unlicensed kennel 
owned by an area man accused in two states of operating puppy mills.


Three adult dogs and 15 puppies - Labrador retrievers and Weimariners - 
belonging to John Tanis were seized by Humane Officers Sandy Boysha and Tina Walter 
of the Lackawanna County Humane Society on Friday. The other dogs were seized 
by Chad Weaver of the Susquehanna County Humane Society and Pennsylvania 
State Dog Law wardens.
A condition of his bail from a previous case is that he isn't allowed to have 
more than two dogs, said Weaver. The dogs were outside without any shelter, 
and some didn't have any food or water, he added.
Tanis, who failed to appear for a Jan. 14 sentencing hearing on charges of 
animal neglect, is nowhere to be found and is considered a fugitive, said 
Wyoming County District Attorney George Skumanick.
Tanis called the Wyoming County sheriff last week and said he's out of the 
state and not coming back, said Skumanick. "He's showing contempt for the court 
and for the system by saying he's just not going to participate in the system 
unless it suits him"
Tanis' name has been turned in to a nationwide computer criminal registry. If 
he's caught, he could go to jail.</content>
