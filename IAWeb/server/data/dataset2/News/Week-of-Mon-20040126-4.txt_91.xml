Jeffrey Masson intends to clean up farming. To stop us exploiting animals in 
any form: no milk, no cheese, no eggs, no wool, no hides and, of course, no 
meat. Keeping animals is wrong; domestication (but not of dogs or cats) a 
terrible cul-de-sac in our relations with the wider world. Farmers should keep to 
crops. 
His route to this conclusion is a dual carriageway, one lane an exposition of 
the inner life of goats, sheep, cows, pigs and poultry. By means of a 
thousand anecdotes, he tries to demonstrate that animals have a higher emotional 
life, a step beyond the mere workings of instinct. Animals are no different from 
humans. Were he Dr Dolittle (and sometimes he thinks he is), he would have a 
merry conversation with any of these species. The faster lane is directed 
towards the wild state of farmed animals, or their avatars. In the dawn of time, 
they enjoyed the full play of their emotions, and domestication is highway 
robbery. 
Ignoring rights and wrongs, we get an entertaining survey of the main 
emotional characteristics of farmed animals and a sobering account of how these have 
been ignored by farmers and, above all, by modern intensive agriculture or 
factory farming. Much of what he says is indisputable, and quite tragic. None of 
us would willingly endorse what is done in our name in the poultry sheds of 
Thailand, the milking parlours of Somerset, the cattle feed lots of the American 
west, or the goose-stuffing farms of the P?rigord. Yet we seem to shrug our 
shoulders and eat it anyway. Impotent, we abdicate responsibility. </content>
