Investigators found more than 100 animal carcasses scattered around the
property of a woman who once ran a kennel from her house.

Mary Meekins of Rowland faces about 150 counts of cruelty to animals and
several other charges, said Katherine Floyd, the equine- and
animal-cruelty investigator for Robeson County.

Investigators first searched the property Sunday and found piles of bones
and shallow graves along with the carcasses. They returned Monday to
impound the remaining live animals and search for the dead ones.
