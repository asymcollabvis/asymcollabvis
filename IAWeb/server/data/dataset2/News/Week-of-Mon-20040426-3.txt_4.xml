Students and area residents settled into Lisa Link Peace Park Thursday and
Friday, protesting the use of animals in scientific research at the
University of Wisconsin.

During the event, which coincides with World Laboratory Animal Liberation
Week, activists advocated to passersby, with one demonstrator sitting in a
cage slightly larger than a mini-fridge.

Student organization Madison Coalition for Animal Rights and community
group Alliance for Animals displayed posters of a primate in a seemingly
painful device. They also showed videos of animals undergoing surgery for
research.
