The first El Paso test of a new, tougher state law on animal cruelty is
set for this summer.

Two years ago, Fabens resident Pablo Camarillo shot and killed his
neighbor's dog, which he suspected was killing his livestock.

Camarillo's lawyer says the Lower Valley farmer acted within his rights
when he killed the dog. But the dog's owner, Reuben Chavez, disagreed and
had law enforcement file a criminal charge of cruelty to animals against
Camarillo.

The case is set for trial this summer and is expected to become the first
El Paso animal cruelty case to go before a jury since a tougher state law
took effect in September.

Under the new law, some forms of animal cruelty may be prosecuted as a
state jail felony instead of a Class A misdemeanor. The punishment for a
state jail felony ranges from 180 days to two years in prison and a fine
of up to $10,000. A Class A misdemeanor is punishable by up to a year in
jail and a fine of up to $4,000.
