WARNING ABOUT SWIFFER WET JETS AND PETS


Hi all,
This warning about a popular cleaning product was just forwarded to
me. My source is very reliable so I felt it necessary to post it here.


  Warning for your animal's health:
  
  
  
   I recently had a neighbor who had to have their 5-year old German
  Shepherd dog put down due to liver failure. The dog was completely
  healthy until a few weeks ago, so they had a necropsy done to see
  what the cause was. The liver levels were unbelievable, as if the
  dog had ingested poison of some kind. The dog is kept inside, and
  when he's outside, someone's with him, so the idea of him getting
  into something unknown was hard to believe. My neighbor started
going
  through all the items in the house. When he got to the Swiffer
  Wetjet, he noticed, in very tiny print, a warning which stated "may
  be harmful to small children and animals." He called the company to
  ask what the contents of the cleaning agent are and was astounded
to
  find out that anitfreeze is one of the ingredients. (actually he
was
  told it's a compound which is one molecule away from anitfreeze).
  Therefore, just by the dog walking on the floor cleaned with the
  solution, then licking it's own paws, and the dog eating from its
  dishes which were kept on the kitchen floor cleaned with this
  product, it ingested enough of the solution to destroy its liver.
  Soon after his dog's death, his housekeepers' two cats also died of
  liver failure. They both used the Swiffer Wetjet for quick cleanups
  on their floors. Necropsies weren't done on the cats, so they
  couldn't file a lawsuit, but he asked that we spread the word to as
  many people as possible so they don't lose their animals.
  
  
  PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!
