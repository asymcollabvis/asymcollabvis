  <content>If efforts to 
protect island habitat off northeast Borneo go as private managers plan, 
they may need some serious military muscle to guard the site’s underwater 
assets from human predators.

Mature grouper, giant clams and exotic corals around Lankayan island would 
fetch big money in a poor region dogged by piracy, tourist kidnappings, and 
blast and cyanide fishing.

“That’s something that we have to discuss with the military, with the 
authorities and with the enforcement police,” says Don Baker, an executive 
with management firm Reef Guardian.

“We don’t want to get hurt and we don’t want to cause any loss of life,” he 
added.

Such potential riches have caught the eye of the Indonesian, Malaysian and 
Philippine governments, making clear the cost of neglecting an area plagued 
by sovereignty wrangles.

Ecoregion planned
Next month, the governments are due to announce plans for a Sulu-Sulawesi 
Marine Ecoregion, tying development for the area’s 45 million inhabitants to 
the fate of its corals, whales and turtles.</content>
