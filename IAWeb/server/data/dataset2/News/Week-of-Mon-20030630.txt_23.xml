WORLD DEMONSTRATION DAY

JULY 16, 2003



Bok Days are the hottest days of the year in Korea. They are also the days 
in which the greatest number of dogs are consumed.  Some Koreans believe 
that eating dog-meat stew will alleviate the summer heat, in addition to 
increasing a man's sexual prowess. While this season spans 30 days, only 
three days are designated Bok Days; this year they fall on July 16th, (the 
beginning of the season) July 26th, and August 15th.



We need as many people to support these demonstrations against dog-eating 
as we can get!  Each year over 2.6 million dogs and hundreds of thousands 
of cats are tortured and killed for human consumption.  Korean dog eaters 
believe that the more a dog suffers, the more tender and sexually potent 
the meat.  Korea's 1991 Animal Protection Law makes it illegal to harm or 
abuse dogs, cats and all other animals, and yet the Korean government does 
nothing to stop these atrocities.  With our show of international force, we 
will lobby the Korean government for stronger, enforceable animal 
protection laws that will protect companion animals from being eaten.



If you are curious about how our demonstrations operate, please see 
www.koreananimals.org/update.htm for examples.  You can also download 
flyers for the demonstrations from the same page.



Please join us on July 16th for our annual Bok Days protests!  All demos 
start at noon, unless otherwise noted. 
Thank you and lets make some noise for the cats and dogs of Korea!
