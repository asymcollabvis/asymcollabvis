  <content>In five years, Pete and Tania Smith made a living off the land 
in the Chautauqua County hills, building a home where the buffalo roam, and 
the elk, red stags and Russian boars, too. 
But at the same time, they arrived near the epicenter of one of the most 
bitterly debated cultural and political issues in America. 
The Smiths converted a former dairy farm into a hunting preserve they named 
Creekside Whitetail. 
They charge hunters big bucks to stalk and shoot the animals that wander a 
fenced-in, 400-acre portion of their property - an area about one-third the size 
of Erie County's Chestnut Ridge Park. 
"This is farming," said Pete Smith. 
He also runs archery and taxidermy businesses at the site, sells deer scent 
from his breeding stock and produces a cable television show for Empire and the 
Outdoor Channel on his 800-acre farm. 
The Smiths are part of a movement to find alternative uses for the 
out-of-business farms that dot upstate New York's countryside. Today, more than 100 of 
these hunting preserves are scattered around upstate's countryside, and another 
seven or eight - mostly specializing in smaller animals such as game birds - 
are in Western New York. 
"We raise animals," Smith said. "They're born and raised here. New York State 
calls this "alternative livestock,' which is exactly what it is."
