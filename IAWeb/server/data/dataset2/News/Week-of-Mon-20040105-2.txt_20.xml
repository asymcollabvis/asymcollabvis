Even sedated, the dog had an incredibly fast reaction time - we learned later 
that she is a Border Collie. She also was developing a sense of increasing 
suspicion. It took six attempts over two days, culminating in the most horrible 
screaming fight I hope never to witness again. By the time the dog was pinned 
to the ground, I had enlisted the help of my partner Julie, Denise and her 
husband Ben, and some guy in a white car who stopped to offer help. Ben succeeded 
in getting a leash on her, but her reaction was so violent and out of 
control, we feared she was too wild to be rehabilitated. Through tears, I called the 
SPCA and waited to have her destroyed.

Above her piercing screams, I heard my cell phone ring. Diane Roadcap, a pet 
psychic and telecommunicator from Virginia whom I had talked with before about 
the dog, had chosen that particular moment to call to see how things were 
going. The dog was utterly hysterical with fear, thrashing at the end of a long 
line on a choke collar, wild-eyed and emitting strangled, screaming snarls. 

Diane was in Lewes that day, and she arrived a few minutes after the SPCA 
agents, who had transferred the dog to their control sticks in place of our choke 
chain. The dog calmed considerably.

Diane?s discussion with the dog was short, first reaffirming the dog?s 
desire to live. Some don?t want to, and have asked to die. Diane explained to the 
dog that we had to take her somewhere else, that it wasn?t safe for her there 
anymore.

Diane told the dog we were sorry we had scared her so badly; the dog told 
Diane she was sorry she tried to bite us. We promised that we wouldn?t hurt her; 
she promised she wouldn?t hurt us, and within a half-hour, the SPCA 
transported her to our house.</content>
