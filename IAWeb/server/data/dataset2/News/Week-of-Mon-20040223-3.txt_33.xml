Lucy Spelman, director of the 114-year old National Zoo in 
Washington, D.C., announced plans to retire Wednesday, the same day a highly critical, 
yearlong independent review by the National Academy of Sciences was released. 
That report found severe deficiencies at the zoo in animal care, pest 
control, record keeping and management that contributed to the deaths of 23 animals 
in the past six years. "I have pushed, pulled and prodded to move the zoo 
forward," Spelman, 41, said in a news conference announcing her resignation. ?But 
now, to accelerate the rate of our progress, I have concluded that it is time 
for me to move on ... I have become a lightning rod for too much attention. It 
has become a distraction for the zoo and the Smithsonian." 
The report is a grim catalog of failure: In January, two endangered adult 
male pandas died after rat-poison pellets that emit toxic fumes were buried in 
their yard for the first time. Two of the zoo?s four Grevy's zebras died in 
early 2000 of hypothermia, and necropsies showed the animals had "no body fat" to 
ward off the severe winter weather. In 2002, after being anesthetized for a 
physical exam to check on a limp, a middle-aged lion was found dead in his cage 
the next morning from complications relating to the anesthesia. Rats are 
depressingly common at the zoo, infesting the habitats of other animals; zookeepers 
were found to misplace and even alter records on animal care.</content>
