RHINEBECK - How much do you really know about how your food is produced? 

If you're like most people, probably very little. We purchase food from
our supermarkets prepackaged and ready to eat, often giving very little
thought to where it comes from and what went into making it. That is,
until an insider like Howard Lyman give us the "plain truth."

Lyman, also known as the "Mad Cowboy," will speak about his
transformation from a cattle rancher to a vegetarian animal crusader at
a presentation of the documentary film "Peaceable Kingdom" at Upstate
Films in Rhinebeck at 1 p.m. on June 19.
...
Sponsored by Catskill Animal Sanctuary, the event, which is free and
open to the public, is part of CAS's opening weekend. There will also be
an open house at the sanctuary, a 75 acre haven for abused farm animals
in Saugerties, on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
...
"When he tells you how things are, he knows first hand," said Roberta
Schiff, president of the Mid-Hudson Valley Vegetarian Society. "People
should come to learn the truth about factory farming and how food is
produced. It is a wonderful opportunity to have (Lyman) in Rhinebeck."

A wine and hors d'oeuvres reception sponsored by the Mid-Hudson Valley
Vegetarian Society will follow the film and presentation.
