Veterinarian says poultry producers and authorities agreed to keep bird-flu 
diagnosis quiet for fear of hurting exports 
The outbreak of avian flu is a result of a miscalculation by the government, 
which decided to cover up the poultry-disease epidemic when it was first 
detected last year, a veterinarian said. 
Though not involved in the decision-making process, the source, a reliable 
veterinarian who asked not to be named, said the government?s initial good 
intentions have become a nightmare for the country. 
He told The Nation that the National Institute of Animal Health under the 
Department of Livestock Development found last year that the mass deaths of 
poultry occurring at that time were caused by bird flu, not cholera and bronchitis 
as the government has tried to claim. 
However, after discussions among related agencies ? farm operators, the 
department and government officials ? agreement was reached that in the interests 
of chicken exports, which are worth about Bt70 billion a year, the true cause 
should not be disclosed. 
?At that time they reached a deal that all chicken in affected areas must be 
killed to control the disease while the government would compensate the 
farmers,? said the source, who works closely with the Livestock Department.</content>
