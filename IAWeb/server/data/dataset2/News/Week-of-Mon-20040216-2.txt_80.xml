The Town of Southampton Animal Shelter currently houses over a dozen dogs 
that authorities say cannot be safely placed for adoption due to exhibited 
aggressive behavioral problems that may pose safety risks to adoptees. As many of 
these animals reportedly show little promise of rehabilitation, and are 
occupying finite kennel space, shelter procedure calls for the liquidation of said 
animals. 
Members of the Town Board met last Friday with Southampton Animal Shelter 
Supervisor Donald Bambrick, Public Safety Administrator Cheryl Kraft, and 
Assistant Town Attorney Celia Gilvary to discuss codification of shelter procedure 
into town policy that would allow for the killing of animals with behavioral or 
temperamental problems. The policy is expected to be voted in by simple 
resolution as early as next Tuesday?s Town Board meeting. 
?We?re going to have a written policy that is basically the same thing we?re 
doing right now,? Bambrick said yesterday. 
Typified as a ?no-kill? facility, the town shelter operates under an 
established euthanasia policy that states no adoptable animals will be put to death. 
Dogs deemed unfit for adoption are defined as having behavioral and 
temperamental problems posing a safety hazard, or animals with irreparable injuries, 
hereditary defects or diseases such as canine distemper or canine parvovirus.
