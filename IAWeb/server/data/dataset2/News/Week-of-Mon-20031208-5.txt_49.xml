  <content>In his dim trailer in the pines, Virgil Butler writes
of killing.

He once shot a man to death in the parking lot of a bar. He served in the
American invasion of Panama and recalled killing enemy soldiers at close
range.

That is not the violence that drives him to his keyboard.

He is haunted, instead, by the nine years he made his way in the world by
slaughtering chickens.

Posted at www.cyberactivist. blogspot.com, Butler's account of a career on
the kill floor is being translated into French and Dutch. Britain's
Guardian newspaper has recommended his Web log as "powerful stuff," a
"must-read." Supporters in Singapore and Russia e-mail questions.
Strangers from across America send cards.

"Virgil's description of the horrible abuse of chickens in our nation's
slaughterhouses ... has turned more people vegetarian than anything else
we did last year," said Bruce Friedrich, director of vegan outreach for
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. With 750,000 members, PETA is
the largest animal rights group in the world. "We get letters and e-mails
about it constantly," Friedrich said.

Tyson dismisses Butler as a disgruntled worker who invented tales of
slaughterhouse horror only after he lost his job. "Some of the things he
says are outrageous," spokesman Ed Nicholson said. Tyson does not plan
legal action to shut down the Web site, he added, because suing would give
Butler only more publicity. Nicholson recently signed up for a chat room</content>
