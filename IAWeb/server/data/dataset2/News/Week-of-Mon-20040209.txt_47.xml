Through dramatic but nonviolent protests, Greenpeace has for more than 30 
years brought the world's attention to - and helped reduce - actions that degrade 
the environment. Nuclear testing, seal and whale hunting and toxic emissions 
all have been curbed in the aftermath of Greenpeace efforts to expose their 
deleterious effects on human and animal species. 
But the group's extraordinary worldwide impact could be cut back if U.S. 
Attorney General John Ashcroft has his way. Greenpeace faces unprecedented 
criminal charges that could significantly diminish the group's ability to operate - 
and potentially chill similar protest acts by a wide array of activist 
organizations. 
The case stems from an action by Greenpeace off the coast of Florida related 
to one of its causes, protesting illegal logging. On April 12, 2002, 
Greenpeace activists in small boats pulled up to a cargo ship outside the Port of Miami 
that they believed was carrying a shipment of mahogany illegally exported 
from Brazil. Two members of Greenpeace boarded the cargo ship with the intention 
of unfurling a banner reading "President Bush, Stop Illegal Logging." 
The duo were blocked in their efforts and arrested, along with four other 
protesters. They were charged with interfering with the Coast Guard and illegally 
boarding the ship. They spent the weekend in jail and paid a fine, typical 
punishments for those who practice the long-honored tradition of civil 
disobedience. </content>
