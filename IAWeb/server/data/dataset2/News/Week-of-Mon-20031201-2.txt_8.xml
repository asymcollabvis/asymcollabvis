As most of our longtime readers know, Watertown was once the capital of
the stuffed geese industry. At one time hundreds upon hundreds of geese
were stuffed here in Watertown and most then found their way to New York
City where the liver was considered a delicacy.

The process was a time consuming one. Geese were force fed noodles several
times a day, including a night feeding. This constant feeding of course
fattened the birds and livers became enlarged. These enlarged livers were
the basis for pat? de foie gras which was served in such fine restaurants
as Luchow's which was located in the heart of New York City until it was
destroyed in a fire in 1995.
...
Although that industry died in Watertown about a quarter of a century ago,
it has not completely ended. It's still being practiced in fashionable
California where these livers are still considered a delicacy.

One of our readers alerted us to a short article in Time magazine this
fall which recounted some mischief created by a band of environmental
activists who are deeply opposed to the practice because it's inhumane.
The article was written by Terry McCarthy.
...
Counters Sarah Jane Blum, a spokeswoman for GourmetCruelty.com: 'If this
were being done to dogs or cats, the producers would without a doubt be in
prison for animal cruelty!'"

We'll leave it up to our readers as to whether this is cruelty to animals
but we're thinking Watertown's place in foie gras lore can't be all wrong.
...
Right now about the only thing remaining from that once flourishing
industry is the Watertown High School mascot, the "Gosling." That name did
come from the goose noodling industry here.

We thought this story was an appropriate one, given that there's been a
pretty big focus on food this week with the Thanksgiving festivities.
