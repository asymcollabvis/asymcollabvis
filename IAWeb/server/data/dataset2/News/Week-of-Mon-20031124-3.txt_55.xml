There is nothing I can do; we're on the point of no return. Sebastian's 
instructions resonate in my mind: "If you fall, whatever happens, you mustn't let 
go of the sled." So here I am being dragged along face down in the snow, deep 
in the Yukon wilderness.


The trail is narrow and my team of dogs is weaving around the trees without 
any concern for its fallen musher. The sky is blue, the sun is shining and 
everything is coated in snow, including me. The silence is shattered by my muffled 
laughter.
"Whooooooa"! The team comes to a halt. I lie there, still hanging on while 
trying to locate the sled's anchor. A few inches away I can see the beautiful 
detail of peeling bark and snow crystals at the base of an aspen tree. Staring 
at this tiny detail, the scale of this vast landscape seems unimaginable.
Space, space and more space - the Yukon lies between Alaska (to the west) and 
the vast expanse of the Canadian Arctic to the east. It's a two-hour flight 
north from Vancouver to the capital Whitehorse. It has a population of 31,000 
(70 per cent of whom live in Whitehorse), but it's also home to 185,000 
caribou, 50,000 moose and 17,000 bears.
The Yukon is also an awe-inspiring playground for adventurous types, though 
the range of activities includes plenty that are far from gung-ho. In winter, 
one of the best ways to explore is to use the network of dogsled and snowmobile 
trails, many of which follow the traditional trapping lines of the indigenous 
people.
