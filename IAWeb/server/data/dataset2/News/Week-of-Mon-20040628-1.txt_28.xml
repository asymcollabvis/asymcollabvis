Most college students lead hectic lives. They balance writing that
Chinese literature essay, cramming for an economics exam, working a
closing shift at the Olive Garden and carving out time for a social
life.

Imagine balancing classes and homework with three part-time jobs,
volunteering, and then deciding to start your own nonprofit
organization. Meet Lauren Zavrel. Zavrel, a University senior majoring
in romance languages, is described by those who know her as bubbly,
friendly, smart and funny. She works for Events Services on campus, the
Cash Store and as a teaching assistant.

But, her true love is helping animals. She volunteers at Lane County
Animal Regulation Authority ( LCARA) and spends much of the rest of her
time running Puptent Inc., the nonprofit organization that she founded
last year. Puptent, which came to life on December 26, 2003, is
dedicated to raising money for animal organizations, promoting awareness
about animal over-population and preventing cruelty to animals.
