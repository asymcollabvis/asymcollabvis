A farm that was investigated by the state last month was determined to be 
free of wrongdoing.
Conditions on the Route 94 farm were investigated after the state received 
calls from passersby who alleged the animals were being treated ?cruelly.? 
Rick Yocum, an agent for the state Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals, said Thursday the farm, owned by resident Glen Senise, was 
investigated last month following the complaints. 
Doreen Ross, of Mount Arlington, was one of the people who called the SPCA to 
report Senise. Ross, who often drives along Route 94 to visit her parents in 
Wantage, said she had seen cows in the field locked up in a small pen with 
water and mud up to their bellies. 
An agent from the SPCA found during a recent visit to the farm that the cows 
were moved to more stable property, Yocum said. 
?Apparently they are in a much better place and we are happy about that. We 
just hope he doesn?t put them back there.?
According to Yocum, the agent who visited the property found a slushy field 
and a lean-to shelter that wasn?t up to par.
