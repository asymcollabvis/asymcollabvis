  <content>Escalating a sporadic, 35-year-old 
protest campaign, opponents of Canada's seal hunt are advocating a travel 
boycott, pushing their cause in the U.S. Senate, even recruiting Paris Hilton. 
Canadian officials say the tactics will fail and the hunt will continue. 
"There comes a point where you just have to say, `This is what we believe,' " 
said Steven Outhouse of Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans. "You 
can't back down every time someone says it's wrong." 
The new protest initiative began after Canada last year announced a quota of 
975,000 seals that could be killed off Labrador and Newfoundland through 2005. 
Protests are likely to intensify as the peak killing period approaches in 
early April. 
"We oppose the hunt for two main reasons -- it's not sustainable and it's 
cruel," said Naomi Rose, a scientist with the Humane Society of the United 
States. The society denounces the hunt as "the largest commercial slaughter of 
wildlife anywhere."
