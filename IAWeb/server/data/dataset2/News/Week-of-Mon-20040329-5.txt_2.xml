They came seeking justice for a nameless, unclaimed Siberian husky that died 
tied to a tree. And they brought Alyeska, Myka, Chomper and other Siberian 
huskies, both purebreds and mixed, to help make their point. 
The demonstrators also held large signs that prompted honks and supportive 
thumbs-up from people driving past the County-City Building in Tacoma on Friday.
"Brutal dog killers deserve jail," one sign read.
"Maximum sentence for maximum cruelty," declared another.
It remains to be seen whether two Wilkeson men will be convicted of felony 
animal cruelty, and how much time they might get behind bars. But on Friday, 
they were sent directly to jail after a brief court appearance.
More than 80 people demonstrated outside the courthouse where Steven Paulson 
and Troy Loney stood accused of tying a stray dog to a tree and killing it 
with a bow and arrow last month. They shot it numerous times with the same arrow, 
pulling it from the animal's body and shooting it again and again, according 
to charging papers filed in Pierce County Superior Court.
At their arraignment Friday afternoon, Loney, 18, and Paulson, 20, pleaded 
not guilty while nearly 90 solemn people watched silently through glass windows 
or waited outside in the hallway.
Defense attorney Dixie Krieg asked that Loney, wearing a gray-green suit, and 
Paulson, dressed in a black coat and jeans, be booked and released without 
bail pending a May 19 trial. Both men willingly appeared in court Friday and 
police saw no need to arrest them after the incident, she said.</content>
