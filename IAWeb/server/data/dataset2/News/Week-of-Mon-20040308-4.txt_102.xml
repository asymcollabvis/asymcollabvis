Adoption info 
To learn more about adopting a pet from the Ashland County Humane Society, 
volunteering or making a donation,
The site also offers more information about Hope, an injured and pregnant 
black Labrador retriever mix, who is looking for a home. If you would like to 
help the humane society offset the costs of Hope's medical bills, the 
organization is accepting donations at any National City Bank or at the society. 
All of the society's cats are feline leukemia tested, have received 
vaccinations and are spayed or neutered before being placed for adoption. Dogs in the 
Tender Loving Dog Care Program also receive vaccinations and are spayed or 
neutered. If you would like to adopt a dog through this program, call (419) 
525-4455. 


Despite not having a home of its own, the Ashland County Humane Society is 
still determined to give homeless, injured pets a chance to survive -- even if 
they have to be creative. 
Take the case of Hope, a very pregnant, very injured chocolate lab, who found 
her way to the humane society last week. Even though the humane society does 
not have a building to put her in, one of the board's members, Laura Bailey, 
found a spot in her home for the risky pregnancy to take place after treatment 
at a local veterinarian. 
Though the group has been without a building for about three years, the 
humane society has grown and developed, and its love for animals has not 
diminished. </content>
