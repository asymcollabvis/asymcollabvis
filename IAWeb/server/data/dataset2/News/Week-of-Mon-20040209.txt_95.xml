A Bridgetown woman has put her first aid training to a rather unusual and 
unconventional use.
Leonie Armstrong, a Bridgetown pre-primary teacher's assistant, received a 
Certificate of Commendation and a letter from RSPCA chief executive Steve 
Vanstan for resuscitating her dog Tannie when she stopped breathing after an 
accident.
Mrs Armstrong said she did not hesitate to use the skills she learnt as part 
of her senior first aid training, with some improvisation.
The accident occurred in November last year at the family farm near the 
Bridgetown-Boyup Brook Shire boundary.
Mrs Armstrong's husband Ken had taken their two kelpies Tannie and Kell to 
move a flock of sheep up a laneway to a paddock, leaving Mrs Armstrong at home.
Mr Armstrong had directed the two dogs through a fence.
While Kell went under, Tannie leapt over and that's where tragedy struck.
While leaping over the fence, Tannie got her hind leg tangled in the wire.
Mr Armstrong tried to free her but in her pain and confusion Tannie bit Mr 
Armstrong several times on the side of the face.
Fortunately they were close to the house and Mrs Armstrong, attracted outside 
by the barking from Kell, yelping from Tannie and yells for help from her 
husband, rushed to the shed to fetch a pair of pliers.
Mr Armstrong had to restrain Tannie firmly under one arm with his hand 
wrapped around her muzzle while he used the pliers to cut her free.
Upon her release, Tannie collapsed and Mr Armstrong discovered she was no 
longer breathing.
