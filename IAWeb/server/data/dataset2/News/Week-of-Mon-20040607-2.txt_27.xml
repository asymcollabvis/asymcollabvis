Consumers in Taiwan are advised to make careful examination when they 
purchase vegetarian products since as high as 70 percent of such food products are 
found to have animal ingredients. 
Lawmaker Chen Chien-ming of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the 
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said in a press conference 
yesterday that 15 of the 21 vegetarian products examined by the Department of Health 
(DOH) were found to contain animal ingredients such as pork, fish, fowl, and 
beef products. 
The samples were purchased from two markets on Hulin Street and Wushing 
Street in the Sungshan District of Taipei City in early March. 
Chen said that the DOH should carefully examine all products described as 
being vegetarian and should impose stiff fines on producers who add animal 
products to their merchandise. 
He noted that statistics provided by the DOH show that of the population aged 
19-44 in Taiwan, one out of every 10 define themselves as vegetarians, 
meaning that the vegetarian population is above 2 million on the island. 
According to the Food Health Management Law, if food producers supply 
counterfeit or alter products, they will be subject to fines of between NT$40,000 and 
NT$200,000. Those who falsely label their products will be subject to fines 
of up to NT$150,000. 
"To protect the rights of vegetarians in Taiwan, the DOH should impose 
stiffer fines," Chen urged. 
He also urged consumers to pay attention when buying vegetarian products. 
Buddhist nun Shi Chao Hui, a professor at Hsuan Chuang University, lamented 
that only two of 21 vendors in the probe could provide information about the 
origin of their products.
