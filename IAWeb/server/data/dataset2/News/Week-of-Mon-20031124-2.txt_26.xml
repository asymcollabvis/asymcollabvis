Cathedral Rocks resembled a row of praying Spanish maidens. Their bowed heads 
were shrouded by mantillas of snow and lichen, draped over tall combs of firs 
and pines.

Half Dome, 2,300 feet taller, stood utterly swathed in white. It looked like 
a cowled Trappist monk, hovering nearby to guide the devotions.

Below these summits, Yosemite Valley lay hushed and still. That was due to 
the muffling effect of winter's first snowfall, which dropped nearly a foot on 
the valley floor, and double and triple that amount at higher elevations.

The valley was also quiet because of a seasonal drop in Yosemite National 
Park visitors. Of its 3.5 million visitors, two-thirds come between May and 
September. Crowds are thickest by summer's end; 585,787 were recorded in August 
2002. They thin out dramatically after the first frost; only 155,554 people came 
last November.

So now, an air of wildness is drifting back down like an ephemeral mist upon 
one of America's most beautiful and popular parks. Amid winter, activities 
such as ranger-led walks don't cease. They become less frequent, but much easier 
to attend and appreciate.

"I can't imagine what this place would even be like, with a lot more people," 
said one guest last week at an interpretive walk. She was one of 16 visitors 
attending.

"Yep," beamed ranger Erik Westerlund. "Perfect, isn't it?"

His topic was Rock and Ice, the forming of Yosemite's monumental creche of 
soaring walls and sculptural spires. Snowbound peaks provided a convincing 
backdrop, as he explained how the Merced River, aided by the great, crystal 
cleavers of glaciers, had hewn at the park's granite over the past million years.</content>
