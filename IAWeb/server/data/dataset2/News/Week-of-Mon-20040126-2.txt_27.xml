Fashion magazines are full of ads with gorgeous models. Here?s one recent 
Ralph Lauren ad: beautiful, young man in tux stands nonchalantly at the bottom of 
stairs casually dangling a violin (he?s just played in a concert, one 
assumes). Standing next to him is another tall, lean model with slightly gray hair. 
Two hunks in a fashion ad for men. Except one of them is the Scottish deerhound 
named Falstaff that belongs to animal expert and animal wrangler Soso Whaley. 
Falstaff was also a guest at a recent roast of comedian Dennis Leary. 
Whaley, who lives in Kensington with her husband, Charles Hadley, and their 
16-year-old son, is featured on an outdoor program found on New England Sports 
Network (NESN) Outdoors called "CamoCountryTV," where she educates viewers 
about animals they might find in the environment. Licensed by the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, she also travels 
throughout New England speaking about the symbiotic relationship between creatures. 
"This is Tiny," Whaley says taking a great horned owl out of a crate. Tiny 
scopes the room and the winter landscape through the window with large yellow 
eyes. "He?s 17 years old and he was found in Arizona, where he was hit by a car. 
It?s common for owls to get hit by cars because they?re not hot-wired to see 
cars as dangerous. Usually they?re just going after prey and that?s all they 
see. The car is in the way." </content>
