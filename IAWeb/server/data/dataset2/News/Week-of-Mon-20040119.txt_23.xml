  <content>Brrrrr! Goodness gracious, it has been cold! None of the dogs want 
to venture too far outside; the cats are staying indoors too. Usually they 
like to snooze in their fenced-in pens, but not lately. These days the animals don
?t want to go out for any length of time. It?s uncomfortably cold for them, 
as well as being potentially dangerous. 
We know that your pets are feeling the cold also. Please remember to keep 
your animals inside as much as possible. Don?t leave your dogs leashed out all 
day, and try to keep your cats from roaming around outdoors. Just imagine how 
awful it would be if we had to be outside in this cold for too long. Please 
think of your pets! 
We?d like you to think about our pets too. Remember the Senior Program we 
introduced awhile ago? We have had a great time adopting our cats into loving 
homes with senior citizens, so we wanted to remind everyone about the program 
again. We have several cats that are still available for free adoptions to 
approved seniors. For instance, Spooker is a black cat with enormous, round eyes. 
She is docile and sweet tempered. Come on over and meet Spooker, Mickey, or 
Agatha. All these cats are friendly and affectionate and so willing to move home 
with you! 
Congratulations to Ceasar, who was adopted earlier this week. He started out 
being fostered by a first-rate family from Lincolnville. Not surprising to us, 
they fell in love with the adorable tiger cat and decided to make him a 
permanent part of their family!</content>
