  <content>Thousands of shahtoosh shawls and ivory items may be ready to 
tumble out of homes across the country, but the government?s amnesty scheme for 
such banned wildlife items seems to have left residents across the northern 
states largely unmoved and officials disappointed. 
The Union environment ministry, still collating countrywide data on its 
six-month amnesty scheme which ended mid-October, says ??a lot of people seem to 
be left out??. Ministry sources say the response from Punjab and Haryana is ??
not so good??. Some people, in fact, admit they never gave declaration a 
thought, though Punjab chief wildlife warden A S Dogra says a few hundred 
applications have come in and most people are becoming conscious of the need to be 
within the law. 
In each state, the numbers are being added up after the last-minute rush, 
which saw fence-sitters rushing to beat the deadline on legalising possessions 
banned for over two decades ? such as the shahtoosh shawl made from the fine fur 
of the highly-endangered Tibetan antelope, ivory or other wildlife items and 
even live animals. 
In UP, more than a thousand forms have come in, residents declaring shawls, 
leopard and tiger skins, ivory and according to a Lucknow report, elephants, 
black bucks and lions. Many, says Delhi-based conservationist Ashok Kumar, still 
do not seem to have declared their possessions for the fear that the 
inspectors will show up and harass them. </content>
