The state of animal farming in this country is abysmal. The small farm and
slaughterhouse have been almost entirely replaced by the vertically
integrated meat and animal products conglomerate; environmental disaster
and unintentional cruelty to animals in the name of efficiency have become
de facto standards in much of the industry. Chelsea Purvis' recent guest
column ("Sustainable Farms Offer More Humane Option," November 18, 2003)
does an excellent job describing the horrible conditions of mainstream
animal farming. What lies outside the scope of Purvis' column, however, is
that elements of the environmental far left have long campaigned for
lifestyle-based non-solutions that fail to address the problem in a
comprehensive manner.

Groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and
others have taken advantage of the situation to vociferously promote
veganism (and, as a less acceptable alternative, vegetarianism) amongst
socially conscious consumers. PETA and its allies have an ulterior motive
grounded in extreme ideology: the belief that any form of animal
domestication is automatically immoral; the leaders of PETA believe that
the only "ethical" contact between humans and animals is no contact at
all. PETA's philosophy would leave us without not only household pets, but
also antibiotics, the smallpox vaccine and most of the rest of modern
medicine.

Veganism is not activism because it is equivalent to abstention; given the
general public's immutable predilection for animal products, veganism is
passivism, it is withdrawal, it is an ideologically grounded ignorance of
a superior alternative.</content>
