The Australian Koala Foundation has written to the government urging it to 
declare the koala a vulnerable species after a survey of 1,000 koala habitats 
found 30 percent no longer had a koala in them and 60 percent had suffered 
widespread destruction. 
"I truly believe that in my lifetime the koala will become extinct unless we 
do something," Deborah Tabarat, executive director of the foundation, told 
Reuters. 
Koalas are protected by law but the eucalyptus trees they call home and which 
provide their only source of food are not. 
There are about 100,000 koalas in Australia, down from an estimated seven to 
10 million at the time of white settlement in 1788. In the 1920s three million 
koalas were shot for their fur.
