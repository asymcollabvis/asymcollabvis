Two nubile women in bikinis wrestled in public in a pool of tofu
yesterday. They literally halted traffic in downtown San Diego.

The women were trying to make a point about the evils of eating meat and
the benefits of consuming more healthy foods ? like tofu, for instance.
The exhibition wasn't very appetizing. 

"Is that oatmeal?" one passer-by inquired as the two women, both members
of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, squealed and splattered
each other with handfuls of tan-colored mush.

Tofu, a custardlike product made from soybeans, doesn't ordinarily look
like oatmeal. But by the time the young women had stomped on it and
rubbed it all over each other's bodies ? to the appreciation of a
leering, mostly male crowd ? the tofu had liquefied into a watery vat of
lumpy gunk.

PETA is a militant group that wages campaigns against animal-research
facilities and fast-food chains, employing catchy slogans such as "Eat
your veggies, not your friends."
