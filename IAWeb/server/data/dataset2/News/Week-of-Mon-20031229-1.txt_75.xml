The Ballarat North woman was one of 22 residents and families who opened 
their hearts and their homes to abandoned dogs and cats at the Ballarat branch of 
the RSPCA over the past two days.

"I was planning to get a kitten for a while, and then I saw the story in the 
paper and thought I would come down straight away," Ms Foster said.

The RSPCA was inundated with a record number of animal lovers wanting to 
claim a pet after an article in Saturday's edition of The Courier revealed the sad 
post-Christmas dumping of two silver kittens abandoned at Victoria Park on 
Christmas Day just 100m from the shelter.

In a sad twist, the two kittens were euthanased yesterday because they were 
infected with the highly contagious cat flu.

"They didn't have a good start to life to be honest," RSPCA centre manager 
Rob Brown said.

But despite the loss, 11 cats and 11 dogs had been taken off death row and 
given a new lease on life - because of the kittens' plight, he said.</content>
