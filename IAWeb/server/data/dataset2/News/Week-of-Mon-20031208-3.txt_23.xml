Rescue group hopes to adopt steer that escaped slaughter.

Dorothy Davies says she is a woman of peace, but she is waging a bizarre
battle of language, culture and principles via phone, fax and e-mail from
her Manchester Township farm.
...
It all started Dec. 2 while Davies was visiting her son, Darian, and his
wife at their home in Arizona. In a story that was publicized across the
country, an enormous 1,800-pound bull escaped from an Eastern Market
slaughterhouse and romped around Detroit?s east side for more than an hour
before being tranquilized by a veterinarian and taken into custody.

The tranquilizer bought the bull ? now called "Jefferson the Re-bull" by
Davies and her colleagues at the Shelter and Safe Haven for Animals Farms
on Mahrle Road ? two weeks of time because it cannot be slaughtered while
it has sedatives in its system.

But time is running short for Jefferson. Davies said misunderstandings in
negotiations between the farm and slaughterhouse owner Nazem Saad have
been complicated by language and cultural barriers.
...
"An action alert went out to 60,000 people last week from PETA (People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals)," she said. "He?s being besieged by
phone calls, just like I am.
...
Animal rights activists and meat eaters alike are upset by the
implications of Jefferson?s eventual slaughter. Davies and the rest of the
SASHA Farms staff are distressed because they are unable to determine what
has actually happened to the steer.</content>
