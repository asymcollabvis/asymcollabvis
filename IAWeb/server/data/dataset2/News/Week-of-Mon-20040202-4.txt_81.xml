  <content>he Zoning Board of Adjustment granted a use variance 
Thursday to Animal Outreach of Cape May County, a nonprofit group planning to build 
a shelter off Bayshore Road.

The shelter is slated for a 3.5-acre site on the west side of Bayshore Road 
near Fishing Creek Road, an area between the North Cape May and Villas sections 
of the township.

After hearing testimony that steps will be taken to limit noise, smells and 
other problems often associated with animal shelters, and that the facility 
will be located toward the center of the property, the board voted 6-0 to grant 
the variance.

About 30 animal advocates at the meeting, many who work as volunteers for the 
nonprofit organization that last ran a shelter a few years ago on the banks 
of the Cape May Canal, cheered after the board vote. No neighbors spoke against 
the variance, and if there had been opposition, Animal Outreach could have 
postponed the vote until the full, seven-member board was in attendance. Five 
votes were needed for the use variance.

The variance is required to run a shelter in a general business zone. Local 
site-plan approval is still needed, and state approvals may be necessary 
because there are wetlands on the property. Cape May County's approval of wastewater 
treatment plans may also be needed, although Animal Outreach President Ellen 
Shaw hopes the facility can be connected to the Lower Township Municipal 
Utilities Authority, so septic system approval will not be needed.</content>
