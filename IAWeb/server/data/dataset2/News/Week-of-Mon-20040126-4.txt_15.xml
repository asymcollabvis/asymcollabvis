    On Aug. 6, 2003, at Paa-Ko subdivision in Sandia Park, citizens got a 
vivid example of what happens to a human-habituated bear under current state 
policy, i.e. "A fed bear is a dead bear" and "three strikes and you're out." Thus 
a friendly, 2-year-old birdfeeder bear was shot dead by New Mexico Game and 
Fish (NMGF) officers in front of horrified BearWatch stewards, residents of 
Paa-Ko.
    Bear #106 had become a problem; even the stewards were not sure what to 
do given the life or death circumstances. We (someone) take an innocent animal 
(a cub), make it people-friendly, and then ...
    There was no question in the minds of state officials about what to do: 
this "ruined," too-trusting bear had to get the big stick in the interest of 
public safety. The opportunity was there; the animal was dispatched and hauled 
off to the dump. Lesson accomplished.
    The finale for bear #106 (tag) is unsatisfactory husbandry, indeed 
unacceptable in our age of presumably enlightened wildlife management/stewardship. 
But what specifically to do about 106 was a real problem given the diversity of 
views of people connected with the matter. The state's policy-solution is 
impeccably rational, tilted to maximizing safety; it is also callous, dogmatic 
and incomplete. The following is an appeal that suggests a partial remedy to 
such dilemmas as the Paa-Ko bear, assuming there will be similar cases in the 
future. Not every "naughty" bear (it's always the bear that misbehaves, is trashy 
and out-of-place, you know) can be preserved, but wildlife services can do 
better than it did on Aug. 6 at Paa-Ko.</content>
