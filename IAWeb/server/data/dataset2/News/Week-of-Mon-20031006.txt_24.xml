ALHFAM seeks papers for presentations, panels or workshops for its 2004
Annual Meeting in Dearborn, Michigan. ALHFAM is an organization of people
who bring history to life. ALHFAM enables it members to make history a
valuable part of the lives of museum visitors. It achieves this purpose
through the exchange and sharing of ideas, information, tools and
experiences centered around accurate, active, participatory, object-based
historical interpretation. ALHFAM, through its membership, is committed to
leading museum interpreters, educators, researchers, administrators,
curators and volunteers in these fields: historical agriculture, historical
trades and manufacturing, historical clothing and foodways, living history
programming, historic site administration, care of collections, and program
delivery within the above specialties.

The theme for 2004, "Sustaining History: Valuing Tradition And Sharing
Innovation," draws on Henry Ford's interest in history and his tradition of
balancing resourcefulness and innovation. At this ALHFAM Annual Meeting,
held in the seventy-fifth year of The Henry Ford, we welcome sessions
related to the tried-and-true or the fantastically new, and how the concept
of sustainability may be interwoven in our programs, institutions, and
communities. As such, we encourage sessions considering how our
organizations and members can promote practices that rely on more
sustainable principles and behavior in a multitude of ways.

Proposals should include a one-page summary of each presentation and a
resume for each presenter. Presenters are expected to submit their
presentation in written form at the conference. Selected papers will be
published in the Conference Proceedings
