The feed ration that goes into a feed bunk, trough or bucket has an important 
impact on animal health, but can also impact human health down the road. 
That's why the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Land O' Lakes Farmland Feeds 
and the Wisconsin Agri-Service Association are teaming up to hold four upcoming 
feed safety meetings to discuss protecting animal and human health through 
proper feed handling and mixing. 
The meetings, offered at no-charge, are an opportunity for feed mill 
operators, mill managers, and on-farm feed mixers to learn more about medicated feed, 
proper feed labeling, good manufacturing practices, federal feed restrictions 
and requirements, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. 
"Wisconsin's animal feed industry has a key responsibility not only for the 
health of our food animals like dairy and beef cattle, poultry, swine, and 
sheep but that responsibility carries over to human health," explained Eric 
Nelson, state agriculture department feed specialist. "Following proper feed 
manufacturing practices can greatly reduce the risk of transmitting diseases, drug 
residues or chemical contaminants into the human food chain." 
The sessions will cover topics such as preventing feed contamination; state 
and federal feed regulations; feed labeling requirements; proper use of animal 
drugs; emerging issues and feed compliance cases. A question and answer period 
will be part of the program.
