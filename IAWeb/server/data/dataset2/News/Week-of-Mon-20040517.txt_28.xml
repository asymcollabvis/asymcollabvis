Vegetarian cat and dog owners are faced with a difficult decision when it
comes to feeding their carnivores: vegetarian in concert with their
beliefs or red meat in concert with what cats and dogs need? Now there's
an answer, and one that's becoming increasingly available.

Ruffy is a vegetarian. Bounding circles and chasing her own tail, Ruffy,
an 11-year-old medium-sized terrier mix, is also extremely excited about
dinnertime. Which is right about now.

"I usually put some grated carrot on top, but today it's banana--I've got
to get rid of them before they go bad," says her owner, Marian
Hailey-Moss, a Manhattan therapist. Ruffy bounds out of the kitchen, turns
in a circle, tail wagging, makes a kind of whining, snuffling noise, then
bounds back into the kitchen again. "Sometimes, since she's on a diet, I
feed her cottage cheese, oatmeal and some raw apple."

Like Hailey-Moss, more and more pet owners are thinking hard about what
they feed their companion animals: Some are cooking up homemade chicken,
brisket and lamb cutlets for a finicky Fido. Still others, concerned with
Kitty's "spiritual cleanliness," or perhaps their own, are buying kosher
cat food. And even more are turning their pets onto a vegetarian
lifestyle, creating a market that a growing number of companies are
springing up to fill.
