Metropoultry: Chickens in the city? Urban egg-layers are fun and legal

Larry and Blythe Knechtel's North Seattle home would look like any other 
Tudor on the block, except it's stucco, not brick. But that's not the big 
difference. Go around back and you'll see what truly sets the Knechtel 
homestead apart.

There, under a large sheltering rhododendron, pecking and putting a slender 
foot to work to send dirt flying, are the girls. Buffy the Insect Slayer and 
her two poultry pals. Dusty, so-named because she's a dusty gray, and Raven. 
Yes, she is indeed a beautiful shiny black, and highly entertaining, which 
is why Blythe talked Larry and their four kids into building a custom 
chicken coop beside the raised garden bed bulging with tomatoes.

"Where else can city kids see chickens and catch an egg when one comes out?" 
asks Blythe.

Nor, surprisingly, is there any shortage of families like the Knechtels, 
decidedly urban folk whose hobby is backyard chicken farming. The birds can 
be found — and sometimes heard — in yards throughout Wallingford, Phinney 
Ridge, Magnolia, Capitol Hill, West Seattle, Rainier Valley and elsewhere.
