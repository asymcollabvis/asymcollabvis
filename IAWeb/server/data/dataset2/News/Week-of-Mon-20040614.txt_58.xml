As Illinoisans, the only way we can stop our senators and representatives 
from doing what we have so strongly voiced our opposition against ["Horse 
slaughter bill not done yet, senate sponsor says," June 2, 2004], is by not 
re-electing them. 
There are so many farms around this country who take these gracious beauties. 
Why don't the owners give them away? Are they having them slaughtered for the 
almighty dollar which they can line their greedy little pockets with? 
I have seen programs where these lovely horses are taken to auctions and sold 
for their meat. Individuals and organizations come in and buy as many as they 
can so they won't be senselessly slaughtered. My hand goes up to them! 
What is our society turning into? It seems to me that people get tired of 
what they have, no matter who will be affected by it. They just toss it away like 
a piece of trash only to replace it with something different or new. Has our 
society become so calloused that they can kill an innocent animal because it's 
a burden on their pocketbook? 
What is this teaching our children who will be our country's leaders someday? 
Oh, it's OK to get rid of this animal because it's too costly; don't love it 
anymore; it's too old, or just tired of it. Eventually we, as a society, will 
not matter at all. Our lives will be worthless. 
This county has lost so much of its moral character. Why don't we, as 
concerned citizens, stand up and fight for what we believe instead of sitting 
passively and doing nothing? It is our right and duty as citizens that we band 
together and show our elected officials we are not going to take it anymore -- 
before it's too late.
