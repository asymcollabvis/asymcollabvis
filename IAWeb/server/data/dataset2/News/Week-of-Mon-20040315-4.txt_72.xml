A Perry County man pleaded "not guilty" to cruelty to animals on Thursday in 
connection with the deaths of 31 chickens.
James Cochran, 24, entered his plea before Perry County District Court Judge 
Richard Avery Jr. A trial is scheduled for May 10.
"The case is pending, and we'll be trying it in District Court," said Don 
McMillian, Perry County assistant district attorney.
Cochran's charge, a Class B misdemeanor, stems from the alleged starving of 
several chickens at his residence. A representative from the People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals discovered the chickens in November 2003 after a 
telephone call alerted the organization.
Cochran's attorney, James Barnes, couldn't be reached for comment.
According to Amy Rhodes, senior animals in entertainment specialist with 
PETA, a PETA activist in Birmingham was contacted after she got the call. The 
representative, along with a Perry County Sheriff's Department deputy, went to 
Cochran's home and allegedly discovered 81 chickens, 31 of them dead and many 
malnourished.
"It is suspected that the animals were being bred for use in illegal 
cockfighting," Rhodes said. "People who demonstrate such blatant disregard for life 
and desensitization to suffering can pose a serious risk to the people and 
animals with whom they come in contact."
In a letter to McMillian, Rhodes states that several roosters had their combs 
removed. "This, as you may know, is a routine practice in the cockfighting 
industry - the combs are removed so that when roosters are forced to fight one 
another, they cannot grab one another's combs," she adds.</content>
