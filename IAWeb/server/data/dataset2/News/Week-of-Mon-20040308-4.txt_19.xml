Can you imagine hooking your dog up to a sled with 15 other dogs, and
running them in four- to five-hour stretches for 9-14 continuous days in
an 1,150-mile race? That would be the approximate distance between
Asheville, N.C., and Bangor, Maine. Under the best of circumstances this
would be grueling, but add to the mix sub-zero temperatures, arctic winds,
snowstorms and ice. This is the Iditarod.

Most of us would consider such brutal treatment to be animal cruelty
punishable by law, but the Iditarod is Alaska's biggest "sporting event,"
and is supported by major corporations. Organizers discount the 120
recorded dog deaths as just a tiny fraction of the animals that run. The
"I-Killed-A-Dog" race has a death rate of 2.9 fatalities for every 1,000
competitors, which is the mathematical equivalent of 290 deaths in the
Boston Marathon during the last decade. Susan Butcher, a four-time winner
of the Iditarod, has publicly stated, "We {dog mushers) wouldn't as a
group, pass anybody's idea of humane treatment of animals."

As Jon Saraceno, sports writer for USA Today stated, "It is the most
immoral, reprehensible 'sporting event' in the USA." Other sports writers
have had equally disparaging remarks about the Iditarod. You can help to
end this brutal race by writing to the sponsors. Go to

dropped their sponsorships of the race after hearing from the public about
the brutal treatment of the dogs.
