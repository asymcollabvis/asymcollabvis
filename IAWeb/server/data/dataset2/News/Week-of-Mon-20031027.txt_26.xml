Jordan Klein wants to know why New Castle police shot and killed his dog.
Jordan?s mom, Tammy Klein, doesn?t think her son?s dog deserved to die, even 
if the dog was running at large. She also wonders how her children will get 
over their newfound hatred of police.
New Castle Police Sgt. Edward Wilks says it?s ?disturbing? the dog had to be 
shot. Had the dog worn a license or current vaccination tag, she would still 
be alive today, Wilks said.
According to police reports, New Castle police picked up the dog, Jenny, on 
Oct. 15. Later that day, police shot and killed Jenny on Silt Mesa, after the S
ilt police would not admit her into their pound.
?The dog had become aggressive,? Wilks said. ?And the Silt pound doesn?t 
take vicious dogs. Garfield County doesn?t accept vicious dogs. Vets won?t take 
vicious dogs. We didn?t have any place to store it.?
Klein disputes the vicious dog allegation. ?There?s no way Jenny acted the 
way they say she did,? Klein said.
In a letter to the editor, 10-year-old Jordan wrote, ?They said my dog was 
very mean and tryed to bite them. Why did the police shoot my dog??
