Beef cattle and 
dairy cattle represent two different types of animal, but their fates are 
identical. What most Americans do not realize is that nearly every dairy cow 
eventually becomes either hamburger or the cheaper variety of steak when her 
profitability drops. Holsteins are frequently culled for slaughter when they are 
between 5 and 6 years old. When you figure that a Holstein first gives milk when 
about 2 years old, that means a productive life on the dairy farm of about three 
years. In that brief life span, everything is done to maximize yield, 
including the regular use of antibiotics and the feeding of high-protein concentrates 
of the kind that used to contain meat and blood meal from other Holsteins, a 
practice that has since been banned.

After poultry and pigs, the dairy industry has become one of the most 
concentrated forms of agriculture in America. The old mental picture of a herd of 
Holsteins standing hock-deep in pasture bears no relation to the way milk is 
produced in much of America. Some herds, especially in the West and Southwest, 
number in the thousands, which means the animals spend their lives in barns on 
cement where they are milked automatically, in some cases on huge rotating 
platforms that look like something out of science fiction.
