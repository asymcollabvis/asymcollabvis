  <content> A national animal-rights organization has issued a plea for
people to flood Duke University Provost Peter Lange with letters and
e-mails calling for a halt to monkey "torture" at the university's primate
center.

There's just one problem with the "Thumbs Down" article in the Spring 2004
edition of the Animal Protection Institute's "Animal Issues" magazine:
It's wrong.

Duke's primate center doesn't harbor any monkeys, it doesn't do any
lasting invasive studies on the lemurs that it nurtures, and selective
quotes included in the article are taken out of context and are misleading.
