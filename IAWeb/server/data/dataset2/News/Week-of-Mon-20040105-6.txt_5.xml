  <content>Just like humans, all animals need love and attention and good care 
to grow up healthy and well adjusted. That was the message of this week's 
guest Treible lecturer, Dr. Kimberly Kal-Downs.
Speaking to an intimate group of animal lovers, Kal-Downs, who is a 
veterinarian at Liberty Research in Waverly, gave suggestions and hints on how to keep 
family pets healthy and happy.
Most of the questions raised at the lecture focused on domesticated animals 
and pets. Kal-Downs emphasized the need for good shelter, regular veterinary 
check-ups, and above all, maintaining a consistently good dietary regime. Taking 
care of an animal is mostly common sense, but constant vigilance and 
attention to the animal is essential.
"Many of the health problems faced by our animals are induced by a bad diet," 
explained Kal-Downs, cautioning people to refrain from giving human food to 
animals. "You must watch for signs of health."
Indications of bad health come in many forms. Some of the ways to tell are in 
the animal's behavior, posture, the sheen of their coat and their interest 
level in normal daily activities. If your dog or cat appears to be healthy and 
shows an interest in eating and playing, chances are "that's a pretty good 
sign" of normal animal health.
If the animal is feeling under the weather, the change in their behavior is 
noticeable. Instead of being active, the animals will usually be drawn into 
themselves and refrain from normal behavior. In some cases, this is the direct 
result of diet. Kal-Downs pointed out that today, there are many different 
dietary supplements for animals. That includes animal feeds that are designed for 
specific weight and age groups. Again, as with humans, animals can sometimes be 
placed on a diet.</content>
