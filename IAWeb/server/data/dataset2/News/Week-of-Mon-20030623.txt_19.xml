EU'S CONSUMERS CALL SHOTS

Imagine it is 2005 and the European Parliament has just passed its latest 
animal welfare directive: Failure to provide dairy cows with access to the 
internet will be now be deemed an abuse of animal welfare. Forced to comply 
or lose access to EU markets, New Zealand farmers protest that our cows 
don't even like computers. Their hoofs aren't well suited to using the 
mouse. Still our paddocks must go online. It might be a ludicrous example 
but sadly it isn't as far from reality as you would think.

The most disturbing theme to arise at this month's international dairy 
development conference in Sweden was that it will be the whims of urbanised, 
animal-loving European consumers, not science, that determine how we treat 
our animals. The agricultural sector is going to have to deal with the gap 
between the reality of farming and the traditional images of cows we see on 
dairy packages and in television advertisements, Swedish and European MP 
Marit Paulsen told delegates at the conference. She said the industry needed 
to address welfare issues and then educate consumers about the realities of 
where their food comes from.
