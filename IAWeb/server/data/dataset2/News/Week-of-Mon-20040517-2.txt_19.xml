The national centre for will promote the "3Rs"
The UK Government is tomorrow expected to announce a radical shake-up in the 
way animal experiments are controlled. 
Science minister Lord Sainsbury will outline proposals likely to include the 
creation of a new national centre for "best practice" in animal testing. 
The new institute will seek to reduce numbers of experiments carried out on 
animals and raise standards of welfare. 
The move comes after plans for a primate research centre were shelved, in the 
wake of angry protests. 
The main aim of this initiative will be to encourage - and fund - research 
into the so-called "three R's": the replacement, reduction and refinement of the 
use of animals in experiments. 
This will include exploring alternatives such as computer simulations and 
experiments on cultured cells. 
The National Centre for the 3R's will provide a hub that will monitor and 
promote best practice in nationwide centres of excellence and science. 
It will be linked to - and build upon - the Medical Research Council's 
existing centre for best practice. 
Welcome move
