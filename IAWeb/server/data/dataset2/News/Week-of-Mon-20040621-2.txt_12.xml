The battle is on to try and rid Denver of a decades-old tradition. 
 
Officials from the National Humane Society met with local advocates Wednesday 
morning at the City and County building to kick off a campaign to drive 
support for a ballot initiative to ban all circuses which use exotic animals from 
pitching their tents in Denver. 
A 15-year-old launched the ballot initiative. Heather Herman hopes voters 
will get behind her cause as much as fellow advocates. She believes these types 
of circuses abuse animals.
"It has been a great honor to be a part of these wonderful exciting steps 
that we have taken to expand our kindness as humans to help animals," said 
Herman. "It's not natural when you got elephants standing on each other and tigers 
jumping through fiery hoops." 
Herman and other activists collected 6,000 signatures to get the issue on the 
ballot for the Aug. 10 primaries. The campaign officially began Wednesday, 
with supporters canvassing neighborhoods to inform people about the proposal. 
However, circuses have a number of supporters in Denver and major circuses 
like the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus say they do not mistreat 
their animals.
