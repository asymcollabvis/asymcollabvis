  <content>Less than a month after publicly lambasting Mayor
Bloomberg for tarnishing her husband's legacy, the widow of Dr. Robert
Atkins already has a new target in her sights - people who don't eat meat.

"They're like the Taliban. They're the vegetarian Taliban," Veronica
Atkins fumes in an interview with "Dateline NBC" set to air Friday in
conjunction with the last American TV interview with Dr. Atkins before his
death.

"They're nasty. I've seen them. I've been to conventions, and everything
else. They are nasty, nasty people," Mrs. Atkins continues.

Mrs. Atkins was infuriated when the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine - a group that promotes a vegetarian diet - obtained the diet
guru's medical records that showed that he weighed a beefy 258 pounds when
he died. 
...
The president of PCRM says the Atkins people brought this on themselves by
using Dr. Atkins himself as a spokesman for the diet.

"Dr. Atkins used details of his own heart health in a completely
inappropriate way for the sole purpose of promoting his diet," said Dr.
Neal Barnard.

"This absurd claim that Atkins was in great heart health has gone forward,
and it has been simply untrue." 
...
As for Mrs. Atkins' feud with Bloomberg, who called Dr. Atkins "fat" and
suggested he actually died from health problems and not a slip on icy
pavement, Mrs. Atkins says the hatchet is officially buried.

The mayor "created quite a storm," she says, laughing. "But I don't think
he really meant harm." </content>
