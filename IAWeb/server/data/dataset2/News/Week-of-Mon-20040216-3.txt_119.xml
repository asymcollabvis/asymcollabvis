Forget, for a moment, that Pennsylvanians already have the right to hunt, a 
right enumerated, and regulated, in the myriad of laws that govern hunting and 
fishing. And forget, for a moment, that nobody is working to take those rights 
away. And forget, for a moment, that such an amendment is superfluous, at 
best, and an incredible waste of time and energy, at worst. 
Yet, sportsmen?s organizations are pushing for the amendment. 
Why? 
Sportsmen?s groups cite a shadowy conspiracy of animal rights activists who, 
they claim, are trying to infringe on the rights of hunters and fishermen, 
even though mainstream animal rights activists say they are trying to accomplish 
no such thing. 
Certainly, animal rights activists have their agenda, and most of it is 
focused on stopping only the most inhumane and cruel practices ? things such as the 
former Hegins pigeon shoot, an activity that cannot be confused with hunting. 
As it is, without the constitutional amendment, hunting in Pennsylvania is 
very healthy. Pennsylvania is behind only Texas in the number of hunters. Last 
year, some 1 million deer hunters took to the woods and bagged an estimated 
500,000 deer. 
There is no concerted effort to stop that. 
If anything, a right-to-hunt amendment could create all sorts of unintended, 
and dangerous, consequences.</content>
