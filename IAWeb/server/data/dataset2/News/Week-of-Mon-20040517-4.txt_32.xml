"During the night to May 19th, members of the Swedish ALF broke into a
building belonging to Goete Olofsson, Selkna gard, Uppsala, in Sweden.
Inside the building thousands of rats and mice were found in horrible
conditions.

This breeder has a permit to breed 100 guinea pigs for the vivisection
industry every year and was raided by another animal rights group in 1998,
when all animals on the farm, 92 guinea pigs, were liberated. After that
raid the breeder said he would quit, but has now instead built new
buildings and started to breed rats and mice.

The ALF rescued as many animals as possible that could be rehomed. Several
hundreds of rats, some mice and also 20 chickens that were bred in the
facilities were liberated.
