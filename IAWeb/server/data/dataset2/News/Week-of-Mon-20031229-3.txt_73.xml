It never ceases to amaze me. 
Spend several months on an investigation into a crooked priest or an expos? 
on a creep who ran the biggest prostitution ring in Canada and in the end 
you'll get maybe two or three e-mails at the most. 
Write about a man's love for his disabled dog and his reluctance to put the 
animal down, and the electronic floodgates break open with dozens of e-mails 
praising mankind, dogkind and even the writer kind. 
Such has been the response to my column in last Saturday's Star about Greg 
Clarke and his German shepherd, Caleb, who suffers from degenerative myelopathy, 
the canine equivalent of multiple sclerosis. 
The story noted how Greg took to carrying Caleb around in a special harness a 
year ago after the disease took away the use of his hind legs. Greg recently 
purchased a doggie wheelchair for Caleb, giving the animal increased mobility, 
but Caleb is clearly living on borrowed time. 
"Caleb will let me know when it's time," Greg says of his constant companion 
for the past 11 years.
