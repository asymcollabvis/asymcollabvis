WASHINGTON - An animal in the United States tested positive in a
preliminary screening test for mad cow disease, Agriculture Department
officials said Friday.

John Clifford, deputy administrator of USDA veterinary services, said
officials learned of the "inconclusive" test result at 5:30 p.m. Friday.
The carcass is being sent to USDA National Veterinary Laboratory in
Ames, Iowa, for additional tests. Results are expected in 4 to 7 days.

Clifford declined to identify the animal or its location until testing
is complete, noting that it's "very likely" final testing could turn up
negative.

"The animal in question didn't enter the food chain," he said. "If
positive, we'll provide additional information on the animal and
origins."
