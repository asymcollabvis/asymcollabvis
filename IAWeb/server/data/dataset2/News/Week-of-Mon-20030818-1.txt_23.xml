Protect dog -- and yourself -- from infected insects
THE BOND Pet owners can take steps to reduce possibility of dangerous bites 
from disease-carrying bugs, Dr. Marty Becker says.


The pandemic diseases that have been in the news lately -- SARS and 
monkeypox, for instance -- seem to have been conjured by a science fiction 
writer.

But in reality, pandemics are not new at all, as we have always been in a 
complex dance with disease organisms.

These diseases have been of particular interest to pet owners because of how 
they may directly or indirectly be passed from animals to humans, a 
phenomenon known as zoonosis.

Zoonotic infections are not new and will not diminish soon. We live in a 
global village, with animals and people existing in close quarters and, in 
many places around the world, highly unsanitary conditions.

Dogs, cats, horses, parrots and many other animals can be carriers of the 
more than 150 known zoonotic diseases that can affect humans through bites, 
scratches, contaminated water and tainted food supplies.

Yet it's important to keep things in perspective, to understand the risks 
and keep a watchful eye, but not overreact in such a way that you're unable 
to enjoy your pet.
