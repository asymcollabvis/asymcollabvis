A federal government truck was rammed in a roadblock and a fisheries officer 
aimed his gun at a man's head during a recent undercover probe of abalone 
poachers.
The incident ended with the arrest of two men suspected of poaching nearly 
450 threatened abalone in waters off Sooke. Worries about dangerously low stocks 
prompted the federal Fisheries Department to ban all commercial and 
recreational catching of northern abalone in 1990. Stocks have not recovered since 
then, and experts say poaching is partly to blame.
