Michigan's first dove season in 100 years is only three months away, and
one of the architects of the law that allowed dove hunting has drawn
fire from some hunters. They say the hunt should not have been limited
to six counties in southernmost Michigan.

allows mourning dove hunting in six counties that border Indiana and
Ohio, states that already have dove hunting (as does Wisconsin, which
borders the western Upper Peninsula).
