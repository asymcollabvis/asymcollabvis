  <content>Has anyone seen ostriches, songbirds, an
80-pound sea turtle, a kangaroo or a cobra?

If so, please contact Mohammed Ahmed Juma, who says he is missing
hundreds of birds and animals from his privately run zoo.

It took 10 years for Juma to create his dream in the Gaza Strip - a zoo
built on a spit of land near a refugee camp. In one night last month it
virtually disappeared, damaged by bulldozers during an Israeli army
incursion into a city swept by violence. Many of the animals were
believed buried in the rubble, though Juma said some probably fled.
...
The plight of the Gaza zoo touched a chord among animal-rights
proponents in Israel.

"This shocks and upsets me, and I wouldn't want such a thing to happen
again," said Eti Altman, founder of the group Let The Animals Live.
...
"I heard one animal ate a sheep, but no one knows what kind of animal
did it," he said. "Whenever they tell me an animal is around, I run to
see it. But I can't find them. There is another snake, a cobra, that is
missing and I am worried because it is dangerous."

But Juma plans to reopen.

"Even if my zoo is destroyed again, I will begin again."
