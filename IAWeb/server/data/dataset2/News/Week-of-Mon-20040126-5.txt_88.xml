MEMBERS OF THE Earth Liberation Front destroyed four houses under
construction outside San Diego in September. The arsonists left a message:
"Development = Destruction. Stop raping nature. The ELFs are angry."

These homegrown terrorists wanted to stop urban sprawl by any means. They
had a simple message, a simple goal and simple minds. Somehow, they had
concluded that development is a form of "raping nature."

The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which has funded the ELF
in the past, has launched a campaign to convince children that animals
should essentially have the same rights as humans and that the meat
industry is to be despised.

Most recently, the group has started distributing to children a graphic
flier that shows a knife-wielding woman stabbing a rabbit. The leaflet
reads, "Your mommy kills animals!"

Also, PETA's kids' Web site asks, "Does the thought of chowing down on one
of your friends give you the creeps? How about eating something that may
as well have been dunked in the toilet? Well, this is the place for you!
This site is for kids who care about animals and don't want to eat them."

At no other time in history have we had access to such a variety of media.
Unfortunately, instead of taking advantage of this, my peers tend to read
only The Nation or to listen to only Rush Limbaugh. The exchange and clash
of ideas is good only if there's an actual exchange of ideas.

It's time to dispose of our partisan mindsets and debate an issue or two
while considering the possibility that the other side might be right - or
at least not as wrong as we originally thought.

A steady dose of reality and debate may be healthier than accepting a
convenient delusion.</content>
