You don't need to be a vegetarian to appreciate a good fake meat menu. I 
refer not to ready-to-eat veggie hot dogs and "chicken" nuggets, but to the 
Chinese Buddhist tradition of elaborate vegetable dishes designed to resemble 
traditional meat-based fare. The "meats," commonly made from wheat gluten or soy, 
are not intended to taste just like real meat (they don't), but to look similar 
and taste good in their own right (they do). 
For vegetarians accustomed to more limited options (broccoli with garlic 
sauce or eggplant with garlic sauce), a fake meat menu is a revelation. Panda 
Garden still has its extensive regular menu, with plenty of real meat, but its 
fake meat menu is far more distinctive and intriguing. The menu includes 
vegetarian "chicken," "pork" and "beef" entr?es, with a fourth section of tofu dishes. 
For appetizers, diners must look to the regular menu, where David and I found 
steamed vegetable dumplings with a mildly spicy dipping sauce. Filled with 
greens, minced mushrooms, egg, ginger and garlic, the dumplings were tasty but 
unwieldy, with a tendency to fall apart. </content>
