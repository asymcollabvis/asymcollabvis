Veterinary Ventures, Inc. has introduced its award winning Drinkwell Pet 
Fountain to the UK. The Drinkwell Pet Fountain is the original and only pet 
fountain with a patented free falling stream, that is most like the running water 
pets crave. The fountain was designed and patented by a licensed veterinarian, 
Dr. Mary Burns, to satisfy a pet's urge for running water. 

The fountain filters and aerates continuously moving water to keep it fresher 
than standing bowl water. The product helps maintain proper hydration in 
pets, an essential ingredient for keeping pets healthy. New to the UK, the 
Drinkwell Pet Fountain is set to be the latest luxury for pampered pets - and it has 
a serious side too.. 

Research shows that one of the best ways to improve a pet's health is to 
encourage the pet to drink more water. By using a 5-inch falling stream to break 
the surface tension of the water, the Drinkwell Pet Fountain continually 
aerates a pet's water with healthful oxygen. Aerated water tastes fresher and you 
can even see it working as tiny bubbles appear in the water. A charcoal filter 
removes bad tastes and odours giving the pet the best possible and most 
appealing way to stay hydrated! It satisfies the urge for running water and helps 
eliminate jumping on counters in search of dripping taps. 

The product helps prevent urinary tract disease in cats by maintaining proper 
hydration. As the veterinarian who created the Drinkwell Pet Fountain knows, 
many cats do not drink as much water as they should. This is one reason the 
urine can become concentrated predisposing some cats to urinary tract disease. 
Cats with urinary tract or kidney disease have a critical need for water to 
support kidney function or prevent crystal formation and obstruction.
