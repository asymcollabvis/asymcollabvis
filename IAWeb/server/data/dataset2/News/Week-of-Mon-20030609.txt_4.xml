  Responses to recent animal rights raid on PetSmart 
  
  "Animals can't defend themselves -- other than say a
  lion or a tiger attacking a cruel trainer.  But for most
  it is up to people to act in defense of animals.  I'm not 
  for advocating violence, but I am for self-defense. Faron 
  Gardner and the others in the AJL are trying to stop the
  cruel exploitation of animals. If the harm to animals can 
  stopped, that outweighs the wrongs of breaking a law or 
  two."  - Cesar Gil, Los Angeles
  
  "For me, the real story is not that a store got vandalized
  and ransacked...the real story is that these hoods believe
  that animals are on the same level as people, and that they
  are justified in hurting people for the sake of dumb animals.
  They need to brush up on Genesis..." - Tony Jones, Alameda
