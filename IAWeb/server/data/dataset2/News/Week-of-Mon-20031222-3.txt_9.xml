  <content> The market for U.S. beef exports
effectively shut down on Wednesday as fallout from the first case of mad
cow disease in the United States widened and public health investigators
combed a tiny Washington state hamlet to find the cause of the potentially
fatal disease.

Japan, Mexico and South Korea, the top three markets for U.S. beef
exports, banned imports after it was disclosed that a single 4-year-old
Holstein cow tested positive for the brain-wasting disease, a discovery
that threatened the $27 billion U.S. cattle industry.
...
Verns Moses Lake Meats, a small slaughter company in Washington state,
recalled more than 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) of raw beef due to concerns
the products may contain meat tainted with mad cow disease.
...
A tissue sample was flown by U.S. military jet to an animal laboratory in
Britain for additional confirmation. Those results will not be ready for
three to five days.
...
After a recent boom that saw many Americans return to beef amid a craze
for protein-rich diets, some consumers said it might be time to rethink
their eating habits yet again.

"This catastrophe might open some eyes to the many problems with
meat-heavy diets," said Amy Joy Lanou, an official of the consumer health
group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. The group offers a
vegetarian starter kit for suddenly fearful carnivores.

Cattle and grain futures traded in Chichago fell sharply on fears that
domestic beef sales will be hurt and exports of U.S. beef will be shut off.</content>
