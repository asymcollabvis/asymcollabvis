Some wetlands, like this 14-acre site at Romeo Plank north of Hall, are too 
wet, too dry or stocked with plants not strong enough to survive..


Michigan has lost hundreds of wetlands to development, land that is vital to 
everything from providing homes for animals to preventing pesticides from 
seeping into the groundwater. 
Lax state oversight has diluted a law mandating the replacement of every inch 
of wetland destroyed by construction. More than half of the 775 wetlands that 
were supposed to be built in the past decade are inadequate. Some are too 
dry, too small, lack the proper drainage or have the wrong type of foliage. 
At least 125 were never built, according to state records. 
"It's sad that the wetlands are gone ... and it makes me mad that nobody is 
really watching," said Nancy Orewyler, a Chesterfield Township homemaker and 
environmentalist. 
The 1979 law requiring the construction of man-made wetlands for lost natural 
ones is tough to enforce because of manpower. The state has 32 environmental 
inspectors to oversee 2,200 wetlands -- almost 70 apiece. There are five 
inspectors total in sprawl-choked Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. 
Michigan officials said they're working to remedy the situation uncovered by 
a 2001 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The state has 
since hired five more inspectors and plans to hire another one this month in 
Livonia.
