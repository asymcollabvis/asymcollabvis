Every time I drive by a McDonald's I glance up and see its proud slogan
-- "Billions and billions served." But I was not one of them.

The reason: I am a strict vegetarian and there was little on the menu I
could touch. Yeah, I could have ordered a McDonald's salad, but it's a
bit like going to a steak house and ordering the shrimp.

That's why I was excited to learn McDonald's had -- with little fanfare
-- recently added a veggie burger to its roundly carnivorous menu.
McDonald's was reaching out to me. Or so I thought. 
...
After I ordered, I grabbed the manager, Hilario, and peppered him with
questions: "Was my McVeggie cooked with meat and/or chicken products?" I
asked.

A bemused smile curled on his lips and he replied: "No, it was not
cooked with any meat products." I queried him again just to make sure.
He nodded slowly as if I was crazy. 
...
At $2.99 it's an unbeatable value, but I couldn't help feeling cheated
by the sort-of-McVeggie. McDonald's, you can do better. Let's just say
I'm not lovin' it.
