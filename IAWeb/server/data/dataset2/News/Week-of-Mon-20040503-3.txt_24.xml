The head of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration on Thursday noted a possible link between a condemned cow
in Texas and eight-year-old animal feed that was not protected against mad
cow disease.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday acknowledged it erred in
failing to test a cow for the brain-wasting disease when it arrived at a
south-central Texas slaughterhouse possibly exhibiting a central nervous
system disorder.
