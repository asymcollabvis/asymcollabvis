French anti-globalisation activist Bove jailed 

Radical French
farmer-protester Jose Bove was arrested at his home on
Sunday and taken to prison to serve a 10-month
sentence for destroying genetically modified plants,
his lawyer said.  
  
       Bove, who rose to prominence in the 1990s for
denouncing globalisation and junk food, was convicted
last November of ripping up genetically modified rice
and maize plants in separate incidents in 1998 and
1999. 
       Though he was sentenced seven months ago, Bove
had refused to give himself up and supporters had
pledged to defend him when police came to take him
away. 
       Bove was arrested at daybreak by dozens of
police who charged through a glass doorway of Bove's
home west of the southern city of Montpellier. He was
bundled aboard a helicopter and taken to the nearby
Villeneuve-les-Maguelone prison. 
       ''The gendarmes went into his house after
breaking through a window, without even ringing the
bell,'' lawyer Francois Roux said. ''He was alone. He
obviously did not resist and they immediately took him
away by helicopter.''
