The catfight's over in the Stillwater Place neighborhood. 
Actually, it wasn't as much of a catfight as it was a fight over cats. 
Specifically, they were four large wildcats - one cougar and three servals - that 
neighborhood resident Gary Dutcher kept in pens in the back yard of his home on 
Chapel Bend Drive. 
Stillwater's neighborhood association sued Dutcher last week, seeking an 
injunction to force him to remove the animals. Allen Superior Judge Stanley Levine 
granted the request Feb. 24, but only after learning the issue is all but 
over - Dutcher moved the cats to an undisclosed location in Steuben County on 
Feb. 26, and the bank that holds the mortgage on his home has foreclosed, forcing 
the property to be sold. 
Instead of a confrontation, Tuesday's hearing was a quiet affair that saw 
Dutcher and representatives of the association's board agree to a preliminary 
injunction that prohibits him from keeping any more wild animals on his property. 
Dutcher told Levine he will vacate the home by early April. 
Under questioning by Levine and association attorney Dan McNamara, Dutcher 
said he moved the cats to Steuben County under supervision of the Department of 
Natural Resources and the Steuben County Sheriff's Department. He did not say 
where they were being kept, but said the facility is regulated by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture and the animals are safe and well cared for.</content>
