PITTSBURGH - Five people have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from what
state investigators called their largest investigation of a dogfighting
ring, one that included breeders, kennels, trainers, promoters and $50,000
purses.

The five men - including a pet store owner - were arrested in November
2002 in connection with the ring that investigators said had arranged
fights between pit bulls in basements and warehouses for at least five years.

According to arrest warrants, the ring sold pit bulls, training equipment,
drugs and surgical supplies. It also trained dogs to fight and had
organized and promoted fights in western and central Pennsylvania since
May 1997
