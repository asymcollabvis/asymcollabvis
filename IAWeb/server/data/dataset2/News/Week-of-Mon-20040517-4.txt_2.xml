Carole Walker will miss watching the two gray Asian elephants from her window 
as she washes her dishes. 
Walker lives in Huntington Woods -- right next to the Detroit Zoo in Royal 
Oak. Her house on Huntington Road faces the zoo's elephant enclosure, where 
Wanda and Winky play and greet visitors. 
But soon, Walker will have new neighbors. The elephants are being moved to a 
place that more closely resembles their natural environment.The Free Press 
reported Thursday that zoo Director Ron Kagan plans to send the elephants to a 
refuge this summer or fall, making the zoo the first in the country to give away 
elephants for ethical reasons. 
Wanda suffers from arthritis in her front legs, and Winky has foot problems. 
Kagan contends the animals will have a healthier environment in a larger 
setting. 
The elephants will be moved to a sanctuary in Tennessee or California where 
they can roam more freely, Kagan said. He said he has gotten dozens of e-mails 
and calls -- most are supportive of his decision but also express surprise. 
Rana Kozouz, the zoo's spokeswoman, said responses flooded into the zoo 
Thursday from at least 14 states. She said most people expressed excitement about 
the decision, calling it the honorable thing to do.
