The DNA proves that the Washington State Holstein found to have bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in December definitely came
from a Canadian herd. You can almost hear the relieved sighs of the
American cattle industry, joined by the sighs of grain farmers and
exporters and meatpackers and the U.S.D.A. itself. In the world of
bureaucratic borders, this fact of origin makes a vital difference. It
will probably allow the United States to retain its status as a non-B.S.E.
nation, and that in turn will allow us to pry open the borders that
slammed shut, stranding shiploads of frozen meat and causing cattle prices
to drop sharply, almost as soon as that one case was discovered.

But in the world of global meat, the DNA doesn't make a bit of difference.
Moving cattle, meat and meat byproducts across borders is one of the
things our agricultural system does extremely well. That becomes obvious
only when the system stops, and it stops only when a disease looms,
whether it's a slow plague like mad cow disease, which takes several years
to incubate, or a fast plague like hoof and mouth disease, which ravaged
British farming just as it was beginning to recover from the effects of
mad cow disease.

Industrial agriculture is indeed industrial. It is designed to move parts
along a conveyor belt, no matter where the parts come from. And if one of
the parts proves to be fatally defective ? a dairy cow with the staggers,
for instance ? then shutting down the conveyor nearly always comes far too
late.</content>
