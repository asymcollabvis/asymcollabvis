  <content>A national animal rights group has appealed to Valencia County's 
administration to remove chaining of dogs from its animal control ordinance. 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said in a press release Monday 
that it had written to County Manager Michael Trujillo and the county commission 
regarding the group's belief that chaining dogs deprives them of social 
interaction that they need and crave and drives them mad. 
The organization recommends that the county follow the lead of many other 
jurisdictions, including Bernalillo County, that have passed anti-chaining 
legislation. 
PETA plans to place a new billboard showing a chained dog next to a tagline 
saying "To Keep Your Family Safe, Chain Your Doors, Not Your Dogs," to alert 
Valencia County residents to the dangerous consequences for humans and dogs 
alike for keeping dogs chained. 
The group's action comes after a pit bull dog attacked and badly injured a 
5-year-old Los Chavez girl last week. 
"People who relegate man's best friend to a chain are planting ticking time 
bombs in their yards and risking their families' lives, said PETA Director 
Daphna Nachminovitch in the release. "Dogs are members of the family, not lawn 
ornaments or furry alarm systems." 
The organization said it maintains an extensive file on children who have 
been mauled and even killed after wandering into chained dogs' reach or 
encountering dogs who had broken free from chains.
