Team 4 investigative reporter Jim Parsons delivered the following report
Tuesday on Channel 4 Action News at 5 p.m.

Western Pennsylvania consistently ranks poorly in national obesity
studies. And we all know that obesity starts in childhood.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 80 percent of the nation's schools
serve lunches that have more fat and saturated fat than is allowed by the
government's own limits, so Team 4 tracked down the numbers for fat
content in local school lunches.
...
Federal law requires schools to keep fat content at or below 30 percent of
total calories. Saturated fat must be at or below 10 percent of calories.
But most school districts in Allegheny County fail to meet those
requirements, according to the most recent inspections by the Pennsylvania
Department of Education.
...
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington, D.C., is
a different kind of advocate: a pro-vegetarian group that grades school
districts around the nation on the nutritional content of their lunches.

Team 4 asked PCRM to grade 10 randomly selected school districts in
Allegheny County.

Keller: "They could all be doing better."

PCRM looked at menus over a two-week period. They handed out Ds and Fs to
all 10 school districts. A major factor in those grades was the districts'
failure to pass their latest state fat-limit inspections.

All 10 districts claimed that they have come into compliance with the fat
limits since their last inspection, so PCRM gave the districts the benefit
of the doubt and issued a new report card. Instead of Ds and Fs, most of
the grades were changed to Bs and Cs.</content>
