  <content>Intalio, Inc., the 
Business Process Management company, today announced that the Dutch Animal Health 
Service, which issues health certificates for farm animals, has chosen Intalio/n3 
to be the core technology for their new central certification system to more 
efficiently monitor the health of livestock. The new system will also enable 
the service to more quickly adapt and implement certification programs, and to 
react more efficiently to animal disease outbreaks like Foot &amp; Mouth disease. 
The central system will complement the service with the ability to process 
foreign health data. 


Intalio/n3, the platform-neutral BPM system from Intalio, Inc., will be the 
core technology for the new system to be named COS-B. Intalio/n3 will bundle 
the existing systems and act as a faster and more efficient central system to 
control and monitor the existing programs. Dutch IT integrator and services 
company PerfectConnection and Belgian BPMS specialist Alexsys Consulting, will 
handle the implementation project. 
Information Technology is crucial in executing and monitoring the 
certification programs of the Dutch Animal Health Service, as computer systems track the 
processes for issuing and attaining a health certificate. In addition, 
computers register who is responsible for executing the related actions for each 
process. Based on this data, the systems initiate the necessary actions and send 
messages to the people involved, such as livestock farmers, veterinarians and 
lab technicians. Furthermore, IT organizes the sending of reminders during the 
processes and then the timely delivery of the results. </content>
