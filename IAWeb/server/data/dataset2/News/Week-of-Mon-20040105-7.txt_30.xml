Carol Flaig of Junction City took the family cat to be declawed in early 
December. She was one of the first pet owners in the area to use the new 
technology that makes trips to the veterinarian less painful.

"The first couple of days she was sleeping it off like they usually do," 
Flaig said. "After that she was already getting back into trouble."
For about a month, a carbon dioxide laser has been used for most types of 
surgeries needed by dogs, cats and other small animals at Marshfield Veterinary 
Service, 916 N. Central Ave., said Tammy Hofstad, small animal veterinarian.

Although the technology has been available in larger referral veterinary 
clinics, Marshfield Veterinary Service's CO2 laser is the first of its kind for 
local pets, Hofstad said. 
Before the vet clinic acquired the laser equipment, people were calling and 
asking for it, she said.

The laser is powerful enough for large animal surgeries, although only dogs, 
cats, ferrets, hamsters and other small animals will fit in the Marshfield 
Veterinary Service's surgery room, Hofstad said.</content>
