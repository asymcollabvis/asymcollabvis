  A Vet has branded a savage attack in which a puppy suffered 35-degree burns 
as one of the worst he has seen for nine years.

The most appalling act of deliberately burning an animal I have seen since 
being a vet Tim Argent, who works at Vets4Pets in Scartho, was appalled by the 
deliberate act of cruelty against eight-month-old mongrel Mollie.

It is thought that boiling water was thrown over her, after she escaped from 
her loving family home in Danesfield Avenue, Waltham.

News of the attack comes a month after a Grimsby man was convicted of a 
vicious hedgehog attack - and days after RSPCA officers warned they were struggling 
to cope with the rise in acts of cruelty.

Scalding water covered most of Mollie's body and has killed her nerves, 
meaning she cannot feel any pain from her wounds - something experts see as a 
blessing in disguise.

Mr Argent said: "This is the most appalling act of deliberately burning an 
animal I have seen since becoming a vet nine years ago.

"At first we were not sure what was wrong with Mollie, but after shaving off 
her fur we could see that she had been very badly burnt.

"Someone has definitely thrown hot water over her because you can see the 
drip marks on her legs and stomach.

"It is lucky the attack was so severe and destroyed her nerve endings because 
she can no longer feel any pain."</content>
