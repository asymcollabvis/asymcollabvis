Nutrition expert Dr. Robert Atkins, creator of the high-protein, low-carb 
"Atkins Diet," may have had heart disease when he died.

Updated: 12:55 p.m. ET Feb. 11, 2004The debate over Dr. Robert Atkins’ 
high-fat, low-carb diet flared posthumously Tuesday over news that Atkins 
himself weighed 258 pounds at his death — though the reasons for his bloated 
condition were immediately disputed.

A physicians group that is highly critical of the diet released details of a 
city medical examiner’s report filed after Atkins’ 2003 death which showed 
the 6-foot doctor was at a weight normally considered obese.

The group claimed the Atkins diet led to weight and heart troubles for its 
72-year-old creator. But his allies countered that he had gained more than 
60 pounds through fluid retention in the eight days he spent in a coma 
before dying last April.

“Critically ill patients, when sustained on fluids in the hospital, gain 
weight,” said Dr. Stuart Trager, chairman of the Atkins Physicians Council, 
a group affiliated with the Atkins diet empire. “He was grossly swollen, so 
much so that his family and associates barely recognized him.”
