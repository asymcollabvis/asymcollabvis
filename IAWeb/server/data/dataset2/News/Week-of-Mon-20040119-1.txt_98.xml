SPOMA Dinner nets over $230,000 to Benefit Mistreated 
Animals

It was an exciting Saturday night at the Millennium 
Broadway Hotel.  The Eighth Annual Society for the 
Prevention of Mistreatment of Animals Benefit dinner 
was hosted by Luella Vedric, a long-time advocate for 
animal rights and endangered species conversation.  
Dinner and dessert was provided by Fruit-of-the-Earth 
Vegan Organic Catering for the $1500 per plate dinner.  
Entrees included black bean and veggie enchiladas, 
barley and seitan pilaf, and chana masala with spinach.  
Dessert choices were sweet potato pie, chocolate applesauce 
cake and fruit spring rolls.

Guests included Jessica Alba, Kim Basinger and Jeri Ryan.   
r'Bear, Melissa Ethridge performed following author and 
songwriter Jimmy Buffett, the keynote speaker.  Paul McCartney 
had been slated as speaker, but was unable to attend due 
to schedule conflicts.

In a chilly moment, r'Bear, the well-known rap artist, 
received a cool reception from several of the conservationist 
purists in attendance, who believe r'Bear's exotic animal 
captive-breeding program located in Southern California 
works against the genetic variability necessary for species 
long-term survivability.  Despite r'Bear's $80,000 donation 
to SPOMA, applause was tepid following his performance.
