Kennewick businessman and property developer Warren Luke has had to put on 
hold his plans for a Tri-City mini zoo after two dogs attacked and killed most 
of his exotic pets this weekend. 
The two dogs, a German shepherd and a German shepherd mix, were captured and 
are being held at Tri-City Animal Control, said Bruce Young, executive 
director. 
Luke said about 30 of his exotic pets were killed in the attacks, which took 
place early Saturday morning and then again early Monday morning. 
The animals killed in the attacks included different types of pheasants and 
other birds, two llamas and three monkjack deer. Luke said he has had some of 
the animals for several years. 
He estimated the animals were worth about $20,000. 
He said he was traumatized by the loss of the animals, as well as the missed 
opportunity for children to see them, and had not considered yet whether to 
pursue legal action against the dogs' owners. </content>
