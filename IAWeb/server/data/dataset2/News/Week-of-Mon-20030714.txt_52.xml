HOUSE NARROWLY DEFEATS BAN ON SALE OF 'DOWNED ANIMALS'

Washington - The House Monday night narrowly defeated
an amendment that would have banned the sale of
livestock so sick or injured they must be dragged to
market, mostly dairy cows that are slaughtered for
meat after they can no longer produce milk. The vote
was 202-199. Voting for the measure were 150
Democrats, 48 Republicans and one independent; voting
against were 162 Republicans and 40 Democrats.
 
In a lively debate earlier in the day, the amendment's
sponsor, Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., noted that fast
food chains like Wendy's, Burger King and McDonald's
don't accept meat from "downed animals," and that the
Agriculture Department prohibits it in the federal
school lunch program. The USDA estimates 130,000
"downers" are brought to slaughterhouses every year.
 
But Texas Rep. Charlie Stenholm, the top Democrat on
the House Agriculture Committee, said that Ackerman
displayed an ignorance of farming. "The gentleman does
not understand the cattle business," said Stenholm,
his thick Texas drawl contrasting sharply with
Ackerman's New York City accent. "I may not be in the
cattle business, but I can tell a good steak when I
see one," Ackerman responded. "This does not a good
steak make." He also called the practice inhumane.
Stenholm said that laws and regulations on the books
already prevent animals from being "inhumanely
handled" before slaughter. "Now there are differences
of opinion as to what is inhumanely handled,"
Stenholm. "I respect those who have a different
opinion than I have."
