Karen MacKenzie is temporarily homeless, but also determined to be reunited 
with more than 30 cats she surrendered to an animal shelter after leaving her 
mobile home in New Eagle. 
Washington Area Humane Society officer Susanne Lewis said she learned May 29 
that MacKenzie was keeping a large group of cats in her station wagon. 
In May, MacKenzie turned over eight felines living in her former residence at 
the Ave Belle Estates mobile home park in New Eagle, Lewis said. 
Lewis said five of the cats were pregnant
MacKenzie said she decided to leave the mobile home park after hearing rumors 
that some of the cats she turned over to the shelter were diagnosed with 
leukemia and that her mobile home was going to be quarantined because of reports 
related to the other cats in her residence. 
"The landlord gave us, supposedly, to the end of the month to be out," she 
said. 
MacKenzie said she and her husband loaded the back of their station wagon 
with about 30 cats and set off for a relative's house.
