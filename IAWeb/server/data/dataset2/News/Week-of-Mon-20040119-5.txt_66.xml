The latest animal health crisis to arise after avian flu claimed its first 
human life in Thailand forms part of a pattern that has gone along with 
industrialisation and mass transportation of livestock. Animal disease now travels far 
and fast in types of farming and food distribution that make it very hard to 
control. 
Thailand exports large quantities of chicken to the UK and other countries in 
Europe. According to figures from the Department for the Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs, the UK imported 36,649 tonnes of poultry meat from Thailand 
in the first 10 months of last year, a 50% increase on the previous year. 
The outbreak has raised two separate concerns: that the flu might spread to 
flocks in other countries, resulting in large-scale losses; and that it might 
have implications for human health. If the virus mutates it might be possible 
for humans catching it to pass it on to other humans, threatening a flu 
pandemic. 
In the age of global trade, retailers and manufacturers source their raw 
materials where they are cheapest. The British poultry industry has struggled to 
compete with prices from south-east Asia and Brazil where labour costs are much 
lower. 
Thailand and Brazil have seen the rapid industrialisation of livestock in the 
last few years as they have pushed for export-led growth. Many UK producers 
meanwhile are barely able to cover the cost of production, as prices have 
fallen in supermarkets.
