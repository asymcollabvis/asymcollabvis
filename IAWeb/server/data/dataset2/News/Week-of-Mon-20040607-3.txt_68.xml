The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has given the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries a much-needed reminder to take the threat to
research from animal rights extremists more seriously. The FBI is right
to say that companies are failing to face up to what has emerged during
the past two or three years as the biggest domestic terror threat in the
US. Its comments apply as much to Europe as to the US.

Companies that use animals in research or testing, directly or
indirectly - which means the entire pharmaceutical industry and most of
biotech - generally refuse to speak out about the issue for fear of
inciting extremist attacks. Individual companies think, understandably
but wrongly, that they can leave it to their trade associations to take
the undoubted risks of making public declarations.

There are honourable exceptions, most obviously the UK-based Huntingdon
Life Sciences. It struggles on, despite being the prime target of
activists, who have tried to shut down HLS not only by direct action but
also by harassing its clients, suppliers and anyone with a business
relationship to it.
