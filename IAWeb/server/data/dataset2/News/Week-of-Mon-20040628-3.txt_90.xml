Events have taken a turn from bad to worse for Sig Stormo, and he's
howling mad about it.

"They're trying to steal my dogs," said Stormo, the Funny River musher
who had his 15 huskies confiscated by the Alaska Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (AKSPCA).

"I'm in a bad spot. They won't return my calls, they won't give the dogs
back and now it looks like I'm going to have to file charges against
them to get the dogs back."

The controversy began June 11 when the AKSPCA confiscated the dogs after
Alaska State Troopers called them in believing the dogs had been
abandoned.

While at the scene, troopers also found evidence that led them to
believe there may have been a marijuana grow operation within the
residence.
