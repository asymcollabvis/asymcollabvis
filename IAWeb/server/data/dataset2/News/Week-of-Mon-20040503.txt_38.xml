A quart of whiskey, a pack of cigarettes and a cube of LSD is better for
you than eating one piece of meat, a doctor once told Peter Burwash,
former Hawai'i resident and Davis Cup champion turned tennis coach, author
and motivational speaker.

"The trauma of the extra (meat-derived) chemicals in the body is
horrendous," Burwash said, clarifying the analogy. "An athlete should have
no meat, fish, poultry or eggs."

A professional tennis player for seven years, motivational speaker for 30
years and vegetarian for 34 years, Burwash spoke about nutrition and
exercise to nearly 150 attendees last Wednesday in the Kuykendall Auditorium.

Burwash spends 150 days a year touring the world as a motivational speaker
and has written 10 books on topics ranging from nutrition to leadership to
teen suicide. The lecture was sponsored by the Vegetarian Society of Hawai'i. 
...
Burwash said Atkins was the "epitome of poor health."

The Atkins diet also requires a significant protein intake. But too much
protein can be detrimental, Burwash said, because it makes the blood
acidic, drains bones of calcium and causes tendons and ligaments to tear
easily.
