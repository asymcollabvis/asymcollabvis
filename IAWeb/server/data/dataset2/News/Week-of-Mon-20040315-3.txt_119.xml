If you could be anyone for one day, who would you be? Paris Hilton? Donald
Trump? A world leader?

What about a vegetarian?

Let's face it. We live in a fast-food nation where greasy cheeseburgers
and oily fried chicken dominate the American diet. And while we know those
things are bad for us, making a change seems like too much work,
especially if it involves giving up meat all together. But what if it was
just for one day?

On March 20th, people across the country will trade burgers for textured
vegetable protein patties during the Great American Meatout -- a spinoff
of the Great American Smokeout. Vegetarianism isn't just about rabbit food
anymore, and health-food stores in all 50 states and several other
countries will be hosting special meat-free festivals and cookouts
featuring the numerous faux-meat products on the market.
...
According to Meatout's statistics, about 30 million Americans have
"explored" a meatless diet, meaning they've at least pledged to abstain
from meat for one day during a past Meatout event. Meatout promotes a
vegan diet (no eggs, dairy, or animal by-products), but according to
Moncrief, any reduction in meat intake is a step in the right direction.
The group encourages the single meat-free day as a way for people to
sample the vegetarian lifestyle.

"It helps when people can try it out for a day and not have to be gung-ho
about it," says Roads. "You don't have to throw everything away in your
kitchen and start over. You can just see what's it's like and maybe start
doing it once a week." </content>
