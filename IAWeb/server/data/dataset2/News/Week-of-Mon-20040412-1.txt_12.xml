  <content>Red-lettered signs around the perimeter of the armory
warned that only circus patrons could enter the property.

Animal rights activist Lisa Bascom said they were likely directed at her
and a handful of others who protested last night's opening of the 55th
annual Irem Shrine Circus.
...
The protesters from Luzerne and Lackawanna counties represented various
animal rights groups such as Voice of the Animals, Justice for Animals and
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Justice for Animals President Jill Mahovich of Freeland recalled a teenage
girl she met while protesting one circus. The girl subsequently returned
to help protest other performances and educate the public about the
treatment of circus animals.</content>
