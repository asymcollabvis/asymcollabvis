Tomato soup with kale and cheese tortellini, vegetarian lasagna and pita
chips with hummus are not exactly at the top of the list on a typical
teenager's lunch menu.

But in fact, several hundred Lawrence High School students patiently stood
in line at the high school cafeteria to sample those vegetarian dishes at
lunchtime two weeks ago.

The students were taking part in the Good Food education program ? funded
by the Lawrence Township Education Foundation with a goal of educating
high school students and staff about food choices.

The change in the menu lasted just one day, but there is a possibility
that it could be repeated later in the year, said Mikey Azzara of Cherry
Grove Organic Farm and Marybeth DiLorenzo, the school district's food
service director.
...
Emily, who is a vegan, first suggested providing options for vegans and
vegetarians in the high school cafeteria to LHS Principal Donald Proffit
last year.

Vegetarians and vegans avoid meat ? but they part company on dairy
products. Vegetarians eat dairy products, but vegans do not because it
comes from animals.

At about the same time, Mr. Azzara approached Mr. Proffit to discuss
including fresh produce ? possibly organic produce ? in the high school
kitchen. Mr. Proffit introduced Mr. Azzara and Emily, and they decided to
merge their ideas.
...
Emily and Mr. Azzara said the objective of the Good Food education program
is not to completely remake the cafeteria into one that serves vegetarian
or vegan fare, but rather to have that option on the side.

"We are basically planting a seed in their minds," Mr. Azzara said.</content>
