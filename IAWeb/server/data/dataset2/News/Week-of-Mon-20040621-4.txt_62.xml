The curtain has closed on Natick's annual Fourth of July big top, but
the organization that sponsored the circus for almost 20 years is
spinning the news this way: They have traded the human cannonball for
Cannondale bikes and brought in Treks instead of tigers.

The Natick Rotary has substituted a family-oriented bicycling event, the
Tour de Natick, held last weekend, for the elephant rides and cotton
candy that many residents relished as a local Independence Day
tradition.
...
Richards and some other Rotarians cited years of low-key animal-rights
protests as one of several factors in their decision to forgo the annual
event.

"It was a combination of a lot of things," said Artie Fair, immediate
past president of the Rotary. The Cole Brothers Circus, a traveling
company that puts on the event, had rearranged its schedule this year,
so they couldn't be in Natick over July Fourth, where several years of
exceptionally hot weather had driven attendance down. Fair and others
said it was simply time for something new.
...
Boston animal rights activist Evelyn Kimber said she didn't need to
witness animals being beaten. She said she protested the circus in
Natick because she believes that wild animals shouldn't be caged and
trucked around the country as entertainment. She said she played a key
role in getting the circus elephants out of Natick's July 4 parade by
educating town officials several years ago. She also distributed
literature to circus-going families outside the tents.

"Some people were not interested, so they'd walk by and wave you off,
while others took the information and read it," she said. "But others
stopped in their tracks and turned around to say, 'Now I can't go in
there because of this.' "
