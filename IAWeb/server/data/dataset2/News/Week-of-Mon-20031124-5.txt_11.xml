It's beyond serious dispute that the Bush White House is dismantling 30 years 
of bipartisan environmental progress, in defiance of law, scientific 
understanding, popular sentiment and common sense.

The Bush administration's horrific environmental reputation isn't just a bad 
rap. The environmental gains Americans have enjoyed for years prove that 
vigorous protection of our natural resources is both effective and consistent with 
economic prosperity. 

The administration's destructive rollbacks threaten decades of progress, and 
they have already begun to take their toll. After three years of President 
Bush's policies, US waterways are getting dirtier, according to the Environmental 
Protection Agency, EPA, for the first time since passage of the Clean Water 
Act. 

Administration policies have driven automobile fuel efficiencies to their 
lowest levels in decades. Superfund clean-ups for millions of Americans in 
tainted communities have been halted because the White House is allowing polluters 
to escape replenishing the bankrupt fund.</content>
