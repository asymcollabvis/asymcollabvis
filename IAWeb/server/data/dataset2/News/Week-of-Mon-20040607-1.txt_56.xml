The Royal New Zealand SPCA has hailed as a "step in the right direction" the 
sentence imposed on a woman who failed to look after 21 Persian cats found on 
her premises. 
Lynn Walker was yesterday sentenced by the New Plymouth District Court to 300 
hours Community Service and banned from owning cats for five years. She was 
also ordered to pay $4,000 in reparations to the SPCA. 
In passing sentence on Walker, Judge Louis Bidois said that she had "failed 
miserably to provide for these cats" 
Walker had earlier pleaded guilty to 41 charges, including 20 charges of 
failing to ensure the animals' needs were met in accordance with good practice and 
scientific knowledge, 20 of failing to ensure they received treatment that 
alleviated pain and distress and one charge of ill-treating an animal. Her 
guilty plea came on the fifth day of a jury trial, in which she had originally 
pleaded not-guilty. 
"We applaud the comparatively strong stance taken by the court over this 
issue. There have been far too many soft sentences in animal abuse cases. However, 
this sentence is definitely a step in the right direction. Hopefully, we will 
see a similarly tough response to other cases in the months and years ahead," 
says the Royal New Zealand SPCA's Acting Chief Executive, Jenny Prattley. 
The case revolved around 21 cats and kittens uplifted from Walker's property 
by the SPCA's North Taranaki branch in late 2000 and early 2001. Amongst the 
rescued animals were several suffering from snuffles, ringworm, gingivitis, 
conjunctivitis, fleas, chronic skin disease and/or severe fur-matting. One cat 
had not had its sutures removed for several months following an operation, 
whilst a kitten with a ruptured eye ulcer needed to be humanely euthanased.
