  <content>Events that let dogs tear into wild hogs within an enclosed 
area would be illegal if legislation approved by a House panel Wednesday becomes 
law. 
Exempted from the proposed ban are "Uncle Earl's Hog Dog Trials" in Winnfield 
and similar "hog baying" competitions that involve dogs herding or cornering 
hogs in a pen. 
But any event staged with the intention of injuring, maiming, mutilating or 
killing the animals would be outlawed by House Bill 1244, sponsor Rep. Warren 
Triche, D-Thibodaux, said. 
Even with the exemption, supporters of the 10-year-old Uncle Earl event 
turned out in force to oppose the legislation, saying it is merely the first step 
in an effort to outlaw all competitions pitting hog against dog. 
"I hate to see a lot of talking about maimed and mauled and killed . . . that 
don't happen," said Jimmy Young, a producer of the Uncle Earl event and a 
boar hunting devotee.
