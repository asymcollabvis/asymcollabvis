The RSPCA has rejected offers by six soldiers to do voluntary work with
animals after they pleaded guilty to cruelly treating and killing kittens
at a military barracks in Townsville.

The animal protection body also said on Tuesday the $2000 fines handed out
to the soldiers were manifestly inadequate when a maximum penalty of
$75,000 was available to magistrates for animal cruelty offences.

The privates from Townsville's Lavarack Barracks appeared in the
Townsville Magistrates Court on Monday on one count each of cruelty to
animals.

The charges stemmed from an April 10 drinking session in which one kitten
was dragged behind a motorcycle then crushed under the wheel of a vehicle
and three others were doused with fuel and set alight.
