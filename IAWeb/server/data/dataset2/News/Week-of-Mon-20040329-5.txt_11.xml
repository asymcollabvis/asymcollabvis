Beef, chicken, pork, veal, whatever animal stock one can think of -- it is
the staple of diets worldwide. It is also the antithesis of the diet and
lifestyle of those select few known as vegetarians.

Vegetarianism is a rapidly growing trend, especially as more information
about the effects of rendering animal products becomes available.

It is evident that several students at New Prairie High School give their
dietary decisions considerable thought.
...
Sophomore Amy Feller has been a vegetarian for nearly two years, but her
reasons for abstaining from meat differ from Hooper's. "I read some
pamphlets from PETA and decided that I didn't want to eat meat anymore
because it's cruel," she explained.
...
Caleb Jackson, a junior, is a two year veteran of vegetarianism and sees
his diet in a different light. "It's not that I don't like meat. It's that
I hate vegetables," he snarled. "I want them to be shredded to bits, then
disintegrated by my stomach acids."

Perhaps the most interesting explanation for vegetarianism comes from
science teacher Bill Spier, who has avoided meat products but not seafood
for more than 28 years. "My first reasons were stupid and immature," he
stated. "It began as an animal rights issue -- when I was young and
ignorant -- but it has since evolved into a sustainable earth issue."

Spier described sustenance as taking the world's current eating habits and
applying them to future living conditions. "By 2050 there will be nearly
12 billion people on this planet -- do you really think we can all live
off cows?" he asked. "You should be thankful that everyone doesn't eat
like an American -- otherwise we'd have nothing left."</content>
