Five Alaskans have been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of 
illegally killing black bears for their gallbladders and other parts prized by 
buyers in Asia, the U.S. attorney for Alaska said Thursday. 
The five suspects, all from Anchorage, were involved in two apparently 
unrelated conspiracies that resulted in at least 14 black bears being taken in 2002 
and 2003, federal authorities said. 
Federal and state law enforcement agencies, meanwhile, are investigating 
other poaching cases involving as many as 50 other black bears in the state, 
according to U.S. Attorney Timothy Burgess. 
Burgess and other officials Thursday declined to give any details about those 
other 50 bears and who might be under investigation.</content>
