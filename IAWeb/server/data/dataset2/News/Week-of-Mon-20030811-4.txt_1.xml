Jon Zwickel wanted to create the ultimate B.C. hot dog. Hence the world has 
the PNE Salmon Sausage, a new taste treat that will be unveiled when the 
Pacific National Exhibition opens Saturday morning.

"There's nothing more West Coast than salmon," said Zwickel, who runs Hot 
Dog Jonny's restaurants in the West End and Ambleside.

"We put together dozens and dozens of different permutations, different 
grinds, different blends, different herbs, different spices, different 
flavourings. This turned out to be the perfect one. It has wild B.C. salmon 
flavoured with fresh ginger, soy and a touch of wasabi."

The PNE Salmon Sausage is emblematic of the changing times at Vancouver's 
fair, which runs from Saturday through Monday, Sept. 1. It's one of the 
PNE's three unofficial food groups -- hot dogs, hamburgers, and mini-donuts 
-- but it is more of an upscale 21st-century snack than traditional fare 
food.</content>
