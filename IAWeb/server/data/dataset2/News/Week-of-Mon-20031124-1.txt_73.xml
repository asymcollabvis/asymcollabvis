George W. Bush will go down in history as America's worst environmental 
president. In a ferocious three-year attack, the Bush administration has initiated 
more than 200 major rollbacks of America's environmental laws, weakening the 
protection of our country's air, water, public lands and wildlife. Cloaked in 
meticulously crafted language designed to deceive the public, the 
administration intends to eliminate the nation's most important environmental laws by the 
end of the year. Under the guidance of Republican pollster Frank Luntz, the 
Bush White House has actively hidden its anti-environmental program behind 
deceptive rhetoric, telegenic spokespeople, secrecy and the intimidation of 
scientists and bureaucrats. The Bush attack was not entirely unexpected. George W. 
Bush had the grimmest environmental record of any governor during his tenure in 
Texas. Texas became number one in air and water pollution and in the release of 
toxic chemicals. In his six years in Austin, he championed a short-term 
pollution-based prosperity, which enriched his political contributors and corporate 
cronies by lowering the quality of life for everyone else. Now President Bush 
is set to do the same to America. After three years, his policies are already 
bearing fruit, diminishing standards of living for millions of Americans.
