Members of the extremist Earth Liberation Front, who once waged their war
to protect the environment by spiking trees and sabotaging logging
equipment, are moving out of the forests and into the streets.
...
Instead of simply protecting trees, the Earth Liberation Front, or ELF ??
made up of loose-knit, individual cells that follow a universal
philosophy of protecting the environment by hurting corporate budgets ??
has now taken to targeting building developers who log land or fill in
wetlands to make way for new homes, say federal officials.
...
Rod Coronado, a former spokesman for ELF and the similar Animal
Liberation Front (ALF), says the group's shift from forest to suburbia is
in keeping with its desire to financially hurt organizations and
individuals that profit from environmental destruction.

"There's a direct relation in the fact that environmental destruction in
one's own community ?? urban sprawl and poor air quality ?? are becoming
the largest issues," said Coronado, who spent four years in a federal
prison for a 1992 arson attributed to the ALF at Michigan State
University's experimental fur farm. 
...
A visit to either the ELF or ALF Web sites, run by press offices that
only act to disseminate information about attacks made by cells, sheds
light on the groups' aims and tactics.\
