"I've been waiting all week for him."
Last week on Saturday night, January 10 ten of Mark Lamb's sheep were killed, 
nine maimed and 17 bitten; quite a destructive night's work for suspected 
wild dogs and an expensive loss for Mr Lamb.
But last Friday Mr Lamb got his man - or rather dog. At 4.30am on his Mole 
View property Mr Lamb trapped one of a number of dogs that have been roaming his 
land and the area. 10 dogs have been sighted in the area in the last two to 
three months.
"The biggest problem is where they live isn't where they kill," Mr Lamb said.
"We need better strategies - aerial baiting is what they used to use - if 
they still used that we wouldn't have this problem, mound baiting is too time 
consuming don't get enough baits out."
It's a sentiment shared by a number of local graziers who like Mr Lamb have 
lost stock to wild dog attacks. In fact, they're so incensed about the problem 
that yesterday morning they set up a protest in front of the National Parks 
and Wildlife Service office in Tenterfield to lobby for the re-introduction of 
aerial baiting in National Parks.</content>
