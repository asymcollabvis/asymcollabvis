The International Whaling Commission  (IWC) is once more meeting in the 
Italian city of Sorrento, and on the agenda is  the proposed resumption of 
commercial whaling. The IWC has an interesting  history. It was founded in 1946 by the 
world?s 14 largest whaling nations to  manage whale stocks. This was 
primarily an economic and not a conservation role,  and was basically a whaling 
version of OPEC. An  attempt to maximize profits from whaling whilst trying to 
ensure that there were  enough whales to keep the populations viable for fishing. 
In this remit the IWC  was totally ineffective, running an old boys club that 
was a whalers charter.  During the 1950?s and 60s an average of over 60,000 
whales of different species  were killed EACH YEAR. The IWC set such high quota 
limits that within 20 years  of being formed the number of blue whales had 
plummeted to the point where the  species was staring extinction in the face.
