  Los Angeles is now seeing some of the first impacts from radical
  animal rights activists groups.  And this time, it isn't limited to fairly
  innocuous protests.  A formerly unknown group calling itself the Animal 
  Justice League smashed cash registers, broke windows and abducted "back 
  room" animals from 3 different PetSmart stores around the city in a 
  coordinated late night raid last night.  
  
  It is believed that the AJL activities were in response to PETA investigations
  accusing the chain of small animal abuses.  According to the PETA web site:
  During an undercover investigation at the PetSmart store in Manchester, 
  Connecticut, a store that has a Banfield Hospital right inside it and that 
  PetSmart boasts of as having an "outstanding pet care team" and an 
  "exceptional pet care record," PETA documented more than 100 small animals
  including hamsters, domestic rats, lizards, chinchillas, and birds deprived 
  of effective veterinary care and slowly dying, out of customers' sight."
  
  Faron Gardner, 32, of Los Angeles, is wanted by authorities in connection 
  with the incident. The Animal Justice League (AJL) states in its website that 
  this would not be the last revenge attack of its kind.
   
  The activities of the AJL appear to be similar to those of other radical groups
  such as ELF and the Revolutionary Cells. Authorities consider these violent acts
  to mark a new chapter in eco-militancy in 2003 that included the vandalism of 
  a Chiron executive's car and the trashing of a biology lab at Louisiana State 
  University last month.
