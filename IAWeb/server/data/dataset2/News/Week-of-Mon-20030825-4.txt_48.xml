SPENCER -- Mike and Kathy Warren insist there's no such thing as bad
publicity. Especially when you make your livelihood training piglets
named Hammy Faye Bakker and Elvis Pigsley to race around a small
track and jump into a swimming pool.

The Tampa-based Warrens travel the Northeast as promoters for
Robinson's Racing Pigs and Paddling Porkers, a carnival-type show
featuring a miniature race track for pigs, complete with checkered
flags and starting gates. The show has been a crowd-pleaser at the
fair for nearly a decade. But this weekend, when the Warrens pulled
into town with their eight-pig team, they ran into controversy.

Accusing the Warrens of animal cruelty, the national animal rights
group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals filed a complaint
with Spencer police. The group took particular issue with the
Robinson's newest race innovation, a 24-foot long, 2-foot-deep
swimming tank that the piglets have to swim across before being
rewarded with food pellets or an Oreo cookie.

"I deal all day with animals exploited for entertainment," said Amy
Rhodes, PETA's animals and entertainment specialist. "It still amazes
me the ways people find to exploit animals for just a laugh or to
line their pockets."

A law enforcement officer from the Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reviewed the charge on Thursday, but
after witnessing a mock race, inspecting the horse trailer the pigs
are transported in, and interviewing the Warrens, Sergeant Peter
Oberton found no cause to press charges.

Still, thanks to the PETA complaint and the ensuing media coverage,
this year's pig races have been a bigger draw than ever. At
yesterday's 2 p.m. race, about 125 fair-goers filled a section of
bleachers and encircled the track.</content>
