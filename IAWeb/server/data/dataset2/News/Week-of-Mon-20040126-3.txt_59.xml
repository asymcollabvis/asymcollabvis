To environmentalists, George W. Bush is the archenemy.
After three years in office, the president has few saving graces, as far as 
environmentalists are concerned. He seems bent, they say, on rolling back the 
nation's most important environmental rules, reversing years of progress 
against dirty air and water.
"It's the worst environmental record in American history," says Carl Pope, 
executive director of the Sierra Club. "The administration consistently favors 
polluting industries over health and safety."
That's why his group and other leading environmental organizations are making 
the defeat of Bush in November a top priority.
One group, the League of Conservation Voters, is breaking with the past to 
focus much of its $10 million to $12 million budget on ousting Bush rather than 
on trying to influence a handful of key congressional campaigns.
