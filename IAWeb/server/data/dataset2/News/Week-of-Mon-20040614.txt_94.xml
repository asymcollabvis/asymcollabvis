Rap Singer Announces New Arrivals to his Animal Ranch Family


r'Bear, an award winner musician and local resident, announced 
yesterday that he has added over 500 new animals to his exotic 
animal sanctuary, Shraavana, since April.

I'm like, you know, a new Daddy 500 times over! r'Bear beamed.  
I should be giving out cigars!

Daddy r'Bear told this reporter he was lucky to find some of 
the species in breeding pairs.

It's hard to find some of these little guys.  For example, the 
Green Dragonbird is really, really rare!

The Green Dragonbird is much like a blue Peacock, but the tail 
sports an iridescent greenish hue.  Other species added to his 
collection are New Guinea Singing Dogs, Amur Tigers, Somali Ostriches, 
Short-tailed Chinchillas and two Northeast Congo lions.

I've got an in with a local goat farmer, r'Bear told us, I 
don't want Pookey, that's the male lion, eating any of my Cuvier's 
Gazelle.

r'Bear plans to have a week-long open house once the animals are 
settled.
