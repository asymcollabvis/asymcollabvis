  <content>A financial helping hand from last weekend's circus in Sebastian 
fell short of the trapeze, officials from the Boys and Girls Club of Indian 
River County reported Tuesday. 
Sarasota's Walker Bros. Circus put on four shows last Friday and Saturday at 
Sebastian Municipal Airport to raise money to help pay operational expenses at 
the club's temporary Sebastian clubhouse. 




"We raised about $685," Leisa Smith-Fulton, the club's executive director, 
said Tuesday. 
Club officials had hoped to get about $2,000 to $3,000 from circus proceeds. 
"I know we didn't hit our goal," Smith-Fulton said, "but we still made some 
money on it. We had a great group of people out there working really hard to 
try to make this a success." 
She said the shows attracted a combined 317 people, including those who 
bought 100 advance tickets. 
Overall, "I think it was a learning event for our first year," Smith-Fulton 
said of the circus fund-raiser. "I think it will have to be put under serious 
consideration if we ever will do anything like this again." 
The Boys and Girls Club provides after-school and summer educational and 
recreation services for local children. 
Last month, the Sebastian City Council agreed to allow the circus to get set 
up on city land as long as it didn't feature elephants or caged animals, such 
as tigers. Council members made that decision after hearing from local animal 
lovers about reported abuse of circus animals. </content>
