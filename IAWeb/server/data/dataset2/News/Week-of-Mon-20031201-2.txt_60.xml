The news may not be as good as it seems
A study of African elephants suggests they may be more numerous than they 
were four years ago, scientists say. 
They think there are from 400,000 to 660,000 elephants across the continent, 
with large numbers in southern Africa. 
But the scientists, from IUCN-The World Conservation Union, are interpreting 
their findings with extreme caution. 
They say one explanation may be that the elephants are fleeing to protected 
areas to try to escape human pressure, thus giving an unduly hopeful picture. 
They say habitat loss and competition between people and elephants for 
resources remain among the principal challenges in elephant conservation. 
The scientists are members of IUCN's African elephant specialist group, and 
their study, the African Elephant Status Report, updates one produced in 1999. 
More questions than answers 
It is the latest in a series derived from a database on African elephants 
which since 1986 has been compiling information from the 37 countries where the 
animals live. 
 
Ivory poachers remain a potent threat
The 1999 report concluded there were at least 300,000 elephants in Africa, 
and possibly as many as 487,000. 
The updated version says the higher figures may be partly explained by 
reported increases in savanna elephant populations in Botswana, Tanzania and 
Zimbabwe.</content>
