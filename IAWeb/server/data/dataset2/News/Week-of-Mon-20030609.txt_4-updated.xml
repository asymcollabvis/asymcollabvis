  Responses to recent animal rights raid on PetSmart 

  Los Angeles is now seeing some of the first impacts from radical
  animal rights activists groups.  And this time, it isn't limited to fairly
  innocuous protests.  A formerly unknown group calling itself the Animal 
  Justice League smashed cash registers, broke windows and abducted "back 
  room" animals from 3 different PetSmart stores around the city in a 
  coordinated late night raid last night.  
  
  "Animals can't defend themselves -- other than say a
  lion or a tiger attacking a cruel trainer.  But for most
  it is up to people to act in defense of animals.  I'm not 
  for advocating violence, but I am for self-defense. AJL is trying to stop the
  cruel exploitation of animals. If the harm to animals can 
  stopped, that outweighs the wrongs of breaking a law or 
  two."  - Cesar Gil, Los Angeles
  
  "For me, the real story is not that a store got vandalized
  and ransacked...the real story is that these hoods believe
  that animals are on the same level as people, and that they
  are justified in hurting people for the sake of dumb animals." - Tony Jones, Alameda
