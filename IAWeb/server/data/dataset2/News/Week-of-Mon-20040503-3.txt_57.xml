The Bombay High Court has permitted the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to 
kill dogs at the Mumbai airport in an "emergency" situation.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice C.K. Thakker and Justice S.A. Borde 
Thursday expressed "concern about passenger safety" and empowered AAI to kill 
dogs in the interest of air commuters. 

The court said: "The right of life was more important to humans and that if 
the dogs can cause a plane crash, they had to go."

The bench observed that under the Airports Authorities of India Act and the 
Aircraft Act, it was permissible for the director general of civil aviation to 
issue directions to deal with passenger safety, which could be compromised by 
stray dogs on the runway. 

The court said that "a high-ranking official would have to decide what 
constitutes an 'emergency' and would have to give reasons in writing why it was 
necessary to kill the dogs".
