SPRINGFIELD - A DeKalb company that plans to restart its horse slaughtering 
operation this month would be barred from selling the meat for human 
consumption under legislation approved Wednesday by a Senate committee.

Setting aside warnings that the bill might actually lead to more abused and 
neglected horses, the Senate Executive Committee voted 9-2 to send the measure 
to the full Senate.

Actress Bo Derek, speaking for the National Horse Protection Coalition, told 
the committee that America should not turn horses into food for other nations.

"They are not livestock," she said. "They're raised as pets. They're raised 
for sport."

The bill's critics say slaughterhouses provide a way for people to get rid of 
unwanted horses. If the practice is banned, the critics say, people who can't 
afford to keep a horse or to have it euthanized are more likely to neglect or 
abuse the animal.
