It's spring, when thoughts usually turn to warm-weather topics like
barbecues, tank tops and colossal home runs by Barry Bonds.

But this year, at least in the online world, spring has raised a wintry
matter, fur - and a flap over three other little letters: c, a, s.

Those three letters have led Neiman Marcus Group Inc., one of the
country's most conspicuous high-end retailers, to try to shut down three
Web sites for the Fund for Animals, a national organization founded in
1967 by former author and humanitarian Cleveland Amory.

Why Neiman Marcus? Because Silver Spring-based Fund for Animals, seeking
to use parody as a weapon in its fight against fur sales, dropped two
letters - "m" and "u" - from the retailer's name, and replaced them with
c, a and s to create a new name for its anti-fur Web sites: NeimanCarcass.

As a result, the unhappy company has filed a complaint against the
animal-rights group's Web-hosting company, Carol/Trevelyan Strategy Group,
or CTSG, with the National Arbitration Forum, an agency that resolves
disputes over Internet domain names.
