Recently a deer tried to cross in front of my car just over the hill south
of Irish Hills golf course. It didn?t make it.

All I saw was the flash of a deer head against the right front fender,
then the sound as the animal hit the right side of my car. The right side
mirror was damaged, there was a large dent in the right front door, and
molding pulled loose and bent sheet metal around the right rear wheel
opening. It didn?t look like that much damage, but the tab came to $2,448.
...
Before the settlers ravaged what is now Ohio, the land was 85 percent
forest, most of it densely covered, a forest that contained a wide variety
of wildlife. The wildlife was a carefully balanced ecosystem that evolved
over eons and kept the population of animals and game birds in check. Part
of that system were cougar and lynx, which were very efficient predators
at keeping the deer population in check.
...
As I said, there are simply too many deer in the county. So what?s the
next move, if any? Well, extending the hunting season and increasing the
number of deer allowed each hunter would bring down the population. But
would that bring the census down to a reasonable level?

Probably not, in my opinion. Thinning out the herd would seem to be an
alternative. But try getting that past the animal rights activists, or
even the governor. Maybe we could get the Ohio Legislature in on this ?
make it illegal for a deer to run into a car.</content>
