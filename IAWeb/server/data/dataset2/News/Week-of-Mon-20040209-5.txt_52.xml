  <content>About 150 animal lovers spent Valentine's Day night helping the 
Northampton County SPCA care for the more than 3,000 animals that pass through 
the agency's doors each year. 
Saturday was the second annual "From the Heart" cocktail reception and silent 
auction to benefit the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 
shelter in Williams Township. MCS Art Resource Center at 1110 Northampton St. again 
donated its gallery and dining area for the event. 
We asked people to have a heart for the animals and to give some of their 
time and, of course, some donation to the SPCA, which is in dire need of 
funding," said Susan Master, a volunteer and board member with the Northampton County 
SPCA. Her husband is Richard Master, president of MCS Industries. 
Founded in 1913, the Northampton County SPCA is a nonprofit agency 
unaffiliated with any government or national group. About 97 percent of its roughly 
$500,000 budget comes from pet adoption fees, fund raising, memberships and 
contributions, said board of directors President Diane Davison.
