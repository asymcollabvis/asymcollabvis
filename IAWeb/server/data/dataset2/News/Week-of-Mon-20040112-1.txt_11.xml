Musher Bruce Milne isn't too worried about not being able to eat beef for
half of the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race as a result of fallout
over a Canadian ban on beef products.

After all, it's a well-known fact that Milne is a junk-food addict who
survives mostly on candy bars during the grueling 1,000-mile race from
Fairbanks to Whitehorse, Yukon.

Rather, it's his dogs that Milne is concerned about. Sled dogs burn up to
10,000 calories a day running the Quest and mushers like to have a variety
of choices for their canine athletes to replenish that energy. Beef ranks
near the top of most mushers'--and dogs'--lists of favorite foods.

"I think you could run the entire race on dry dog food if your goal is
just to finish," said Milne, who has completed the race three times. "If
your goal is to run your dogs to the top of their limits, then you've got
to have all the nutritional options at your disposal." 
...
Even if mushers end up being able to use beef for their dogs, mushers
won't be able to send any personal food into Canada that contains beef
products, said Rich, who advised mushers to avoid beef in their personal
food supplies.

That doesn't bother Milne, who subsists mostly on Almond Joy candy bars
during the race.

"I did expand my diet this year," he said. "I bought some Reese's Peanut
Butter Cups."

Neither is West, who is "almost" a vegetarian, concerned about not being
able to eat beef when she's mushing through Canada.

"I mostly eat Power Bars and Gatorade anyway," she said.
