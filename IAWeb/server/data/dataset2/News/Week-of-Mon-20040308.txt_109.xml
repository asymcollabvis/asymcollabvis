Founder of Animal Hunting Ranch visits Shravaana

Following meetings with officials from the US Department 
of Agriculture, the founder and CEO of international 
import/export firm Global Ways (not a publicly traded 
entity), Mr. Madhi Kim, visited the local exotic animal 
sanctuary 35 miles north east of San Diego.

The sanctuary, dubbed Shravaana, is a private animal 
sanctuary run by the megastar Rapper r'Bear, winner of 
two Grammy awards.  Singer r'Bear, established the exotic 
animal ranch two years ago in an effort to help repopulate 
the world's endangered species.

The two exotic animal ranchers spent the day touring the 
5600 acre ranch.  Mr. Kim, a former game warden from 
Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve, also owns an animal 
ranch. The Texas ranch, Wild Things, provides exotic 
animals for big game hunters willing to pay thousands of 
dollars for the chance to bag a wildebeest or a scimitar-
horned oryx.

The tour included the now-completed lake, which is home 
to a flock of Trumpeter Swans and several species of endangered 
fish, including the Alabama Shad and the Clanwilliam Redfin.
