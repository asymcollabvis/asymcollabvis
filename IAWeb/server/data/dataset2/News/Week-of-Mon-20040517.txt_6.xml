Beijing authorities' decision to suspend local regulations on animal
welfare has aroused public debate from home and abroad.

According to a draft released by the Beijing municipal government on its
web site earlier this month, rules for the treatment and welfare for
animals being transported and facing slaughter were to be prescribed for
the first time in the country's history.

But the law was withdrawn on Wednesday, just four days later, without any
explanation. Sources within the city's Legal Affairs Office said the draft
had already been debunked as impractical by experts, and there are no
other plans for animal welfare legislation within the next five years.

The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), a non-governmental
organization, said it was sorry to hear about the decision.

"More than 100 countries including some developing countries in Africa
have adopted laws against abusing animals, but China has not," an IFAW
statement said.
