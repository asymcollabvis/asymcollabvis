Complaints about a television pictures showing turkeys suffering in a Bernard 
Matthews barn in Norfolk have been dismissed by the media watchdog. 

The company made its complaint after GMTV broadcast secretly-filmed footage 
in November 2002 describing a "disgraceful scene" in a fattening unit at Weston 
Longville, near Norwich. 

One turkey was shown with soiled plumage, another lying on its back and one 
with a broken leg.

But Ofcom, which regulates the communications industries, threw out all 
Bernard Matthews' complaints. It described the programme as "a legitimate 
investigation of conditions at the Bernard Matthews' barn".

David Joll, managing director of Bernard Matthews, said the company was 
surprised and disappointed by the findings.

He said that any injuries to the turkeys were caused by the programme makers 
themselves. 

He said: "Someone smashed the side of the shed and shone a light at the 
turkeys while they were asleep, panicking them." 

Mr Joll said that a Granada film of the same turkey shed only days later, 
conducted in the daytime with the company's permission, painted a very different 
picture, but that Ofcom ignored this.
