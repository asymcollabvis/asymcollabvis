There are some hip-hop artists who don't drink Tanqueray and Aliz? and
want no part of the late-night trips to the BK.

Take the socially conscious rap duo Dead Prez, whose song "Be Healthy"
includes the lyrics: "I don't eat meat, no dairy, no sweets ? only ripe
vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat." 
...
Singer Erykah Badu, an active promoter of the vegan lifestyle, has been
known to stop by Seattle's Hillside Quickies Vegan Sandwich Shop, where
the Howell family serves up Tempehstrami Subs and Macaroni and Yease to
the tune of hip-hop, dance hall and reggae.

"We get a lot of artists that come through here," said Ayinde Howell, a
25-year-old vegan and local rapper/poet, "the ones who take care of
their bodies." 
...
At the forefront is rap mogul and entrepreneur Russell Simmons, a strict
vegan who is active in People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
Simmons has, among other things, signed on to PETA's anti-fur ad in
Women's Wear Daily, recorded a radio public service announcement
promoting vegetarianism and participated in the PETA Celebrity Cookbook.
