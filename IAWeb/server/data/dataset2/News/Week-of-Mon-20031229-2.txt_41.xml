When Carmen Gale's 6-year-old twins return to school following winter
break, they'll be packing lunch if beef's on the school menu.

The Poulsbo mother made the decision to remove beef from her family's diet
following news of the country's first case of mad-cow disease. 
...
Though the USDA, cattle ranchers and state and federal officials assert
that there is little threat to humans, some consumers are nonetheless
cutting red meat from their diets and exploring meat alternatives such as
organic foods and vegetarian meals.

At the Gale household, steak, ground beef and London broil were served at
the dinner table two to three times a week, in addition to the occasional
stop for burgers at McDonald's. But concerns over the safety of red meat
mean a diet without it ? for good.

"My problem is the big unknown," Gale said. "Nobody can say for certain
that it's safe." 
...
Rachel Bjork, co-coordinator of Northwest Animal Rights Network (NARN), a
Seattle-based animal activist group, wasn't surprised by the news of
mad-cow disease in the U.S.

"It was pretty much a matter of time. The food that they feed the animals
is not in any shape or form natural," Bjork said. "For the USDA to say
there is no worry is ludicrous."

While NARN advocates a vegan diet, Bjork said people should consider the
origins of the food they eat and consider alternatives to meat.

Vegetarians eat a diet free of meat, fish and poultry, but may consume
dairy products and eggs. Vegans avoid all animal products, including eggs
and dairy.

"We feel that the vegan diet is ideal, but we also realize that for a lot
of people it takes a while" to adapt to, she said. "We are happy if people
just reduce their meat consumption. If we have 100 people reduce their
meat consumption by 10 percent, that's going to save a lot of animals."
