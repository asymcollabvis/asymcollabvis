Please join us for a conversation with Kath Rogers, Campaign Director for the Animal Protection and Rescue League. Tomorrow we'll be speaking with her about APRL's industry-wide investigation of foie gras production in the United States. We'll cover what foie gras is, how it is produced, and what the industry says about this incredibly invasive and cruel practice. Kath will also let us know what we can do to help the geese and ducks.  For our Toronto listeners, we'll learn where foie gras is available and which restaurants to pressure to take this "delicacy" off their menus.

As part of a new feature to Animal Voices, the program will also include a veg restaurant review. Tomorrow's restaurant of choice will be Fressen, a gourmet vegan restaurant located on Toronto's Queen Street West.
