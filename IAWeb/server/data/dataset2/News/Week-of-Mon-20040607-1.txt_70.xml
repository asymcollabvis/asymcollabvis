"Before-and-after photos of saved horses fill albums in the home of Large 
Animal Protection Society President Joanne Mauger.

But some of the most compelling photos are of a recent victim, a malnourished 
Amish-owned horse found running loose with hooves in desperate need of 
attention and pieces of plowing harness still attached, rubbing deep sores along its 
body, slapping its bleeding flanks. A buggy horse, it was made to pull a plow 
meant for a much larger draft horse.

Mauger and Laps treasurer Pat Geiger said the group has seen it all, but the 
state of the horses they see always saddens them.

Laps is to horses, sheep, goats, pigs and cows what the Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is to dogs and cats. Laps was chartered by the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1988 as a non-profit humane agency.

Like the "animal cops" seen on the Animal Planet television network, Laps 
agents have badges and respond to complaints of abuse, abandonment and neglect. 
Agents educate, advise, investigate and, when necessary, issue citations, 
legally seize animals and make arrests. The agency enforces the cruelty laws and 
serves Chester, Delaware, Lancaster and Berks counties with a working board and 
an unpaid staff of volunteers.
