A bark is a bark, or is it? Depending on how your dog bellows or bays, he 
could be saying he loves you or uttering curse words. That's where the 
Bow-Lingual comes in, the newest fad for curious cur owners who want to translate woofs 
into words. But how effective is it? Our two subject dogs - Garth and Chelsea 
- have never met. Yet they said a lot of the same phrases, at least according 
to the dog translator. A coincidence or a consumer crock? You be the judge.
Garth spotted the jogger who dared run by our house and told her off in a way 
only dogs can.
"Take your best shot!" he bellowed, at least according to the Bow-Lingual, 
the latest gadget for pet owners who want to discern what their dogs are saying.
"That's not what I want," he barked a minute later, expressing frustration - 
according to the hand-held translator - as he watched a neighbor from across 
the street walk to her car.
 
"I can't get my point across," he bayed, turning to my husband and me as he 
surveyed the comings and goings of our neighbors through the front door.
"Repeating yourself doesn't help," added Garth, our 13-year-old 
liver-and-white English springer spaniel.</content>
