  <content>Howard the dolphin won't be strong enough to move to another 
aquarium anytime soon, despite months of trying to improve his health, West 
Edmonton Mall officials say.
Gary Hanson, the mall's general manager, announced last fall that the mall 
wanted to move Howard, but didn't think he would survive the trip because of his 
frail health.
Since then, the mall's only surviving dolphin has had a specific diet and 
exercise regimen to get his strength up, although the effects have been minimal. 
"He's not gaining enough weight, that's the real concern," Hanson said this 
week, adding that Howard's health has not been deteriorating.
A new home for Howard, should he be moved, hasn't been picked.
Brian Joseph, a marine veterinarian from Redding, Calif., has been seeing 
Howard once a month since 
August. He said Thursday that Howard is improving bit by bit, and eating more 
than he has in five to 10 years, but is still not close to being able to 
survive a move out of the mall. "I expected this to be a gradual process and it's 
turning out to be one." 
Joseph said Howard may never be healthy enough to move. "I look at his 
progress with guarded optimism."
Animal rights groups are growing impatient, believing that West Edmonton Mall 
is dragging its feet on moving Howard to another location.
Animal rights activists don't believe the dolphin's health will improve until 
he is moved.</content>
