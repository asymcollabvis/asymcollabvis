Losing your pet can be a devastating experience. Fortunately, there are some 
things you can do to help prevent this from happening or, at least, ensure a 
safe return if it does. 
 Here are some tips to help protect your pets from getting lost: 
Spay and neuter all pets. Both males and females are much less likely to 
wander if they have been altered. Spayed and neutered pets live longer, have fewer 
health problems and are happier in general. 
Make sure all of your pets are wearing current identification tags. Make sure 
the writing on the tag is legible and accurate. Without any identification on 
your pet, they are helpless, may become homeless and your chances of 
recovering them are greatly reduced. 
Inquire with your veterinarian about getting a microchip implanted in your 
pets. There are several microchips available and your vet can help you choose 
which one is most prevalent in your area. 
Make sure your yard is pet-proof so that your dogs cannot escape. Also, keep 
any gates locked so visitors do not accidentally leave them open. 
Always have your pets on a leash and never let them roam free in the </content>
