WAUCHULA - Out in the woods, the new morning ambles through the oaks and
pines, fluttering sunlight over the creek, pestering jaybirds into
raucous gargle and wooing the creature from his dreams with fresh fruit,
herbal tea and the old, sweet promise: You are safe here.
...
This center, with its spacious habitats and almost 2,000 feet of
elevated chutes which extend the animals' range and choice, is one of
nine nonprofit great-ape sanctuaries in North America and the only one
dedicated to orangutans. It is not a breeding facility. It is not a zoo.
Although scientists, animal-care experts, students and supporters often
visit, it is not open to the public, and when a convertible full of
smiling, sunburned tourists pulls into the driveway, Ragan apologizes
but firmly turns the sightseers away.

''This project is not about being hands-on with the apes,'' she says.
``. . . It's about them learning to live with their own species, to
provide for them, as much as we can in a captive situation, a more
natural life.''

''She's probably the top of the heap just because of the quality of
care,'' says April Truitt, director of Primate Rescue Center, a
monkey/chimp center in Nicholasville, Ky. In fact, almost any human
wandering around here for the first time -- poking into the kitchen as
lunch is scooped into big bowls or hearing caregiver Ray Rooney call
''All right, Roger. I'll be right there,'' to a chimp literally
screaming for attention -- may succumb to an entirely peculiar notion: I
wish I were Radcliffe.
