"Many discriminating cat lovers know exactly which cat they want, are
willing to pay for it and won't settle for anything less," reads the Web
site for Genetic Savings and Clone, now is charging pet owners $50,000 to
clone their cat.

What the Savings and Clone calls "discriminating cat fanciers," most
Americans would call suckers or fools. (Another word a friend used was
"creepy.") Thousands of cats are killed every day in animal shelters for
want of a home. Yet some people with more money than sense are ready to
spend more than the median U.S. household income in a vain attempt to sort
of recreate their cat.
