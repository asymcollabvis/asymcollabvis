Honk if you're sterile. That is, if you're a goose. 
Canada geese in parts of Oregon, including those in Bend, are participating 
in an experiment aimed at keeping the honking birds from proliferating. 
In short, many Canada goose populations in Oregon are about to get dosed with 
birth control. 
Beginning last week, officials from Wildlife Services began training Canada 
geese to eat cracked corn and a breadlike substance from black plastic tubs set 
out along rivers. Wildlife Services is a predator/pest-control agency within 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Once they've got geese comfortable with eating the bait, officials will begin 
adding nicarbazin, an antibiotic created for chickens. 
Although the antibiotic was originally intended to protect poultry from 
bacterial parasites, nicarbazin had the unintended consequence of rendering the 
birds sterile, according to Dave Williams, state director for Wildlife Services. 
Essentially, the drug prevents eggs from being fertilized, said Kathy 
Fagerstone, research program manager for the National Wildlife Research Center, the 
Fort Collins, Colo.-based lab for Wildlife Services. 
For five years Fagerstone and her researchers have tested the drug in a 
controlled environment at the lab. </content>
