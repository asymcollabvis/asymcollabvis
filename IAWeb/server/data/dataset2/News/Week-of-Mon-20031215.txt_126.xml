  <content>The brain keeps track of the movements it makes so as
to process sensory input accurately and coordinate
complex movements gracefully. In this chapter we
review the brain's strategies for keeping track of
fast, saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is
by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands, or
corollary discharges. It has been difficult to
identify corollary discharge signals in the primate
brain, although in some studies the influence of
corollary discharge, for example on visual processing,
has been found. We propose four criteria for
identifying corollary discharge signals in primate
brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from
superior colliculus, in the brainstem, through
mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field, in the
prefrontal cortex. First, the signals must originate
from a brain structure involved in generating
movements. Second, they must begin just prior to
movements and represent spatial attributes of the
movements. Third, eliminating the signals should not
impair movements in simple tasks not requiring
corollary discharge. Fourth, eliminating the signals
should, however, disrupt movements in tasks that
require corollary discharge, such as a double-step
task in which the monkey must keep track of one
saccade in order to correctly generate another.
Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior
colliculus to frontal eye field, we concluded that it
does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The
extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these
signals, particularly in the realm of sensory
perception, remains unknown pending further studies.
Moreover, many other ascending pathways from brainstem
to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys,
and some of these, too, may carry corollary discharge
signals.
