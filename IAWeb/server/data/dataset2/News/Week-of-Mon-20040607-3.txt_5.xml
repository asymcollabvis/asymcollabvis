cup of coffee while Jasmin, her miniature dachshund, tucks into a fishburger 
with a side order of salt-freerice crackers. 
``She eats ordinary dog food at home, so coming here is a treat,'' saysthe 
24-year-old. ``There aren't many places you can take dogs in Tokyo, soI can see 
why cafes like this are popular.'' 
The most doting owners and their pets visit twice a day to sample human 
andcanine versions of Deco's keynote dishes, such as chicken and vegetablespring 
rolls, chiffon cake and blueberry muffins. 
The existence of specialist fast food outlets for pooches is only 
oneindication of the Japanese obsession with their four-legged friends. 
The country is in the midst of a pet boom, as more pensioners turn toanimals 
to fill the gap left when their grown-up children leave home. 
Nearly a fifth of Japanese - 24 million people - are aged 65 or older;by 
2050, they will account for 35% of the population. 
More than 48 million households keep pets, mostly dogs and cats,according to 
a survey by the pet food manufacturers' association. Lastyear, the number of 
dogs rose by more than 1.5 million to 11.3 million. 
Whether their owners are young or old, there has never been a bettertime to 
be a pooch. In up-market Tokyo neighbourhoods, cafes servingmeticulously 
prepared snacks give the term a dog's dinner a whole newmeaning.
