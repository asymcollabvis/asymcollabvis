The Humane Society of the United States and other groups are
waging a letter campaign to request the judge reject a proposed plea
bargain in an animal cruelty case about a dog found with its nose and
mouth taped shut.

Robert M. Lamano, of Elmer, pleaded guilty in January to animal cruelty
for abuse to the mixed Blue Heeler dog. The dog was named "Rusty" by
officials at the Society to Protect Animals in Carneys Point Township,
where it was taken after it was found on the border of Lower Alloways
Creek and Quinton in September. Because of the irreversible nature of its
injuries, the dog was euthanized.

Martin Mersereau, manager of the domestic animal abuse department at
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said New Jersey has
"notorious and poorly worded" animal cruelty laws that have allowed other
convicted animal abusers with light sentences.

"This won't be the first case in New Jersey where a vicious and
blood-thirsty person got off with a slap on the wrist," he said.
"Hopefully, this will be one of the last."

In January, Gov. James E. McGreevey signed an animal cruelty bill into law
that made animal cruelty that resulted in the animal's death a
third-degree crime. Repeat offenders are now subject to third-degree
penalties, up to five years in jail and $15,000 in fines.

Lynn Walker, of Providence, Rhode Island and a member of animal rights
group Voices for the Voiceless, has been requesting people send letters to
Forester through e-mail lists. Four of those lists go to people throughout
the U.S., while one goes to Great Britain.

Walker found out about the case through an e-mail list from someone in
Atlanta, Georgia. She said she was incensed when she learned about the
potential plea bargain. She sent a letter to Forester, asking that he
insure all sides had been heard in the case. </content>
