It is understood the makers of a much anticipated cat-specific toxin 
developed in Victoria are interested in trialling the toxin on King Island, although 
it was not clear whether the toxin was included in the initial program. 
Senator Murphy would not put a cost on the program. 
"It is not a cat eradication program, it is a control program that can evolve 
over time," he said. "The thing is, we have to start somewhere." 
He said Dr Kemp's office had been very supportive of the idea and he hoped an 
announcement was only a matter of weeks away. 
State Game Management Services Unit senior officer Graham Hall told the 
meeting -- held after the opening of the two-day pheasant season yesterday -- he 
had visited penguin rookeries on King Island only to find the remains of birds 
killed by feral cats. 
"You might see a wing here, a leg or something there, then you'll see feral 
cats, but not many penguins," Dr Hall said. 
"They are having a big impact." 
The King Island Game Bird Association has placed a three-year moritorium on 
breeding and releasing pheasants, which costs $30-$40 a bird, and put the money 
into feral cat control instead.
