The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity had planned to help the animals of Athens after 
an incident involving the death of a raccoon -- but one organization doesn't 
want their services. 
The local chapter of the fraternity imposed sanctions on the three men 
involved in the incident, including social probation for one month and 25 hours of 
community service at the Humane Society. 
But Lisa Klein, executive director of the Athens Area Humane Society, said 
her organization has declined the men's service based on the information she 
knows about the occurrence. 
"We're not comfortable because there has been an incident where one of the 
gentlemen committed animal cruelty and the other two undertook an act of 
violence with the animal," she said. 
The incident happened last December when the fraternity brothers were 
involved in killing, skinning, burning and consuming a raccoon near the fraternity 
house. 
Erik Zimmerman, from Marble, N.C., was arrested and released on bond for 
misdemeanor animal cruelty charges resulting from his alleged involvement in 
shooting and killing the raccoon. 
The fraternity decided to sanction them with community service, requiring 
that they work with animals, said Claudia Shamp, director of Greek Life. 
But Klein said she was not aware of the fraternity's plans to send members 
there for community service until she read about it in the newspaper.</content>
