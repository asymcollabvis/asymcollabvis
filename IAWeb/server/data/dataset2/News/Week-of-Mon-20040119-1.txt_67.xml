  <content>The chair of the Kentucky Animal Control Advisory Board said 
she will push for new state laws to regulate puppy production operations like 
those police shut down in Grant and Harrison counties this month. 
Board chair and Boone County Animal Warden Becky Reiter has worked closely 
with Grant County over the past two weeks to coordinate the seizure of 124 dogs 
from two kennels that police said were unlicensed and operating as puppy 
mills. 
The Grant County Sheriff's Department first began hearing complaints about 
facilities operated by Ken Sunbom and his former wife, Tonya Moukaddem, more 
than two years ago, according to Chief Deputy Chuck Dills. 
But Reiter said the lack of state laws regulating such businesses prevented 
officials from taking action against the pair's operations until very recently, 
when evidence of animal abuse and neglect was uncovered at the kennels. 
"I'd like to see the animal cruelty statutes strengthened more to include 
some regulation of anyone selling puppies to the public. That would have 
eliminated some of this two- to three-year-long process over which we've watched this 
situation develop," Reiter said.
