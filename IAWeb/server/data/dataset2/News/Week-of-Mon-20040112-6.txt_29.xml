The Penn researchers have used gene therapy on these mice to produce 
increased levels of IGF-1, or insulinlike growth factor-1, a protein that promotes 
muscle growth and repair. They have done this with mice before birth and with 
mice at four weeks of age. A result has been a sort of rodent fountain of youth. 
The mice show greater than normal muscle size and strength and do not lose it 
as they age. Rats altered in the same fashion and then put into physical 
training -- they climb little ladders with weights strapped to their backs -- have 
experienced a 35 percent strength gain in the targeted muscles and have not 
lost any of it ''detraining,'' as a human being will when he quits going to the 
gym.
