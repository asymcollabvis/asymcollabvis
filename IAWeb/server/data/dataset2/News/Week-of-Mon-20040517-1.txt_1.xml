  <content>Force-feeding of ducks and geese to make
foie gras, a delicacy to some and an outrage to others, is a step closer
to being outlawed in California after the state senate's passage of a bill
on Tuesday.

The bill proposed by John Burton, the state Senate's top Democrat, would
also ban the sale of foie gras made from the enlarged livers of force-fed
geese and ducks.

The bill, passed on a vote of 21-14, now goes to the California Assembly,
where one lawmaker has also proposed a bill to ban farm-raised salmon in
the state.

Only one farm in California currently produces foie gras. If Burton's bill
becomes law, it would become effective in seven and a half years and would
impose fines of $1,000 for force-feeding birds in foie gras production.
