URGENT ACTION ALERT:
Support Letters from Needed for AB 1857, to Ban Declawing of Large Cats in 
California, Deadline for Support Letters: March 9

The California cat declaw bill has been amended and reintroduced as AB 
1857. This bill would now make it illegal for any person to declaw native 
or exotic wild cat species in the state of California (i.e. lions, tigers, 
cougars, leopards, lynxes, bobcats, cheetahs, jaguars, etc.). AB 1857 would 
still allow declawing of these cats for therapeutic purposes (i.e. 
legitimate medical needs). The bill would not apply to domestic cats. 
(Domestic cats were removed from the legislation due to strong opposition 
from some in the veterinary community, including the California Veterinary 
Medical Association.) AB 1857 is authored by California Assemblymember Paul 
Koretz.

CVMA has reportedly removed its opposition from the bill, given the new 
wording, but AB 1857 may still face opposition from segments of the 
entertainment industry which want to continue to declaw cats held in 
captivity for entertainment or viewing purposes. AB 1857 is scheduled to be 
heard by the Assembly Committee on Public Safety on Tuesday, March 16. 
Support letters, particularly those from California residents and animal 
organizations, should be sent to the Committee by Tuesday, March 9, to be 
listed in the bill analysis distributed at the hearing.

Please send a support letter by March 9 to the Public Safety Committee 
office. Letters should also be sent to the committee members. (Note: 
Assemblymember Paul Koretz also sits on this committee so support letters 
to his office can thank him for his leadership on this issue.) Below are 
some important points to emphasize in submitting your support letters. T
