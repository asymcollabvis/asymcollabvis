Teens Jad Carson and Barry Gessner haven?t met a duck, ostrich, fish,
cow or pig they didn?t like ? to eat.

Should they feel shame about that as students at traditionally liberal
George School in Middletown? No, they say.

But the many pro-vegetarian, anti-meat-eating posters, Tshirts, stickers
and classmates at their school made them feel their meat-laden meals
were bad ? immoral even.
...
They formed a carnivorefriendly club called MEAT (Mammals Eating Animals
Today).

The club sparked lively debates between meat-eaters and vegetarians
across the campus when it started in January.

Their weekly meetings ? the guys call them ?meatings? ? became popular
and attracted as many as 27 students.
...
Jeannie McStay of the Baltimore-based Vegetarian Resource Group, a
national nonprofit group that supports and provides information on
vegetarianism, said people today are more aware of meat-free food
options and the animal rights group PETA (People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals) has raised awareness of animal cruelty issues.

?More and more teens are made aware of what it took to get that meat on
their plate,? McStay said. ?The cruelty issue made me become vegetarian.
I grant it, health is a great benefit.?

What about Jad and Barry and other committed meat lovers? McStay had
this to say, ?I think if they visited a slaughterhouse or an industrial
farm they?d feel differently.?

Jad and Barry said they know about the slaughterhouses and industrial
farms. They?ve seen videos from PETA about animal cruelty.

?It is disturbing, but you can go free range,? Barry said.

Jad added, ?It?s better for the animals plus it tastes better.?
