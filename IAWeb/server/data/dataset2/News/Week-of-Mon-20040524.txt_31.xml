Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich is realistic about the
chances of winning his party's nomination - nil - but he's confident he
still has the power to influence the party platform, he told enthusiastic
supporters in Missoula on Monday.
...
The Ohio representative and former Cleveland mayor drew loud cheers for
his plans to stop the war in Iraq, repeal the Patriot Act, get out of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, and develop a national, single-payer,
nonprofit health insurance program.

It's his hope, he said, that a strong showing in the final primary
elections of the year - including Montana's on June 8 - will send
delegates bearing his message to the Democratic National Convention in
Boston in July. Montana delegates have 21 of 4,322 total votes at the
convention.
...
The first question from the audience was about something a bit more
mundane, however: "Do you fish?"

Kucinich, a vegan, laughed and answered, "No. . . . I'm fishing for votes
right now."
