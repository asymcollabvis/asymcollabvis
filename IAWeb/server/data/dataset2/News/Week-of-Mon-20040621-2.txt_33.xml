TALLAHASSEE - Advocates of greater protection for manatees were unsuccessful 
in blocking a high-speed boat race this weekend off St. Petersburg that they 
say poses significant risks for the endangered mammals. 
The U.S. Coast Guard issued a permit for the race this week to Offshore Super 
Series Inc., a nonprofit group headed by St. Petersburg businessman and 
powerboat racer Todd Werner. About 40 boats that reach 130 mph will race around a 4 
1/2- mile course. 
The race has been planned for months, but the Coast Guard withheld the permit 
until Monday after race officials agreed to manatee protection suggestions 
made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These included moving the race 
course from a quarter- mile off shore to a half-mile and moving an area for boating 
spectators on the side away from shore. 
Race officials also agreed to put a manatee spotter in the air. Teams of 
boaters will be looking for any animals that swim into the race area as well.
