I felt compelled to respond to the article in the Wednesday, Feb. 4 issue of 
the paper concerning the neglected horses seized from a Newville farm. It is 
unfortunate that a horse needs to ?have one foot in the grave? before a humane 
society acts. I am not at all surprised that in this case at least one dead 
horse was found on the property. 
This recent case reminds me of a similar case in Cumberland County last year. 
Several of my friends reported an underweight horse to the West Shore Humane 
Society. After five calls, the humane officer finally visited the farm in 
question. Upon contacting the officer after her visit, she explained that the 
owner told her the horse (named Nugget) was just ?old? and ?sick.? 
I spent over an hour on the telephone with this humane officer explaining 
that an 18-year-old horse was not old. Further, I described several possible 
conditions (all treatable) that could cause Nugget to be so pitifully thin. My 
friends and I called the humane society several times requesting a vet examine 
Nugget. We even offered to pay for the exam. All to no avail. 
Eventually, a friend could not stand by any longer and purchased Nugget from 
the owner for $800. After a visit from an equine dentist (cost of $40) Nugget 
began to put on weight. He had a common problem that horses develop as they 
chew their food. Within three months of the dental care Nugget gained 
approximately 250 pounds and began looking like a normal, healthy horse. So much for 
this horse being ?old? and ?sick.? 
While I can forgive the officer?s lack of knowledge, I cannot excuse the 
carelessness with which the humane society pursued this case. Perhaps the farmer 
provided the required food, water, and shelter, but when you can count every 
rib on a horse, something is wrong.</content>
