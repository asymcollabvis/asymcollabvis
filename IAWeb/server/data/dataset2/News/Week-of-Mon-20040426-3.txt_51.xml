The U.S. Department of Agriculture is gathering information on a cow that
was ordered destroyed at a West Texas meatpacking plant, a USDA official
said Friday.

USDA spokesman Ed Loyd said he didn't have confirmation on why the cow was
killed Wednesday, and said it wasn't immediately clear if a tissue sample
had been taken for a test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known
as mad cow disease.

"Clearly there was some indication that there was a problem with this
animal," Loyd said. "We cannot jump to the conclusion that it has BSE.
That's why there's testing done."
