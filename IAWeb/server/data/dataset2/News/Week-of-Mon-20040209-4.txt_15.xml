Warning signs of periodontal disease: 
Bad breath -- one of the first signs of dental disease. 
A yellowish-brown crust of plaque on the teeth near the gum line. 
Red and swollen gums. 
Pain or bleeding when your pet eats or when the mouth or gums are touched. 
Decreased appetite or difficulty eating. 
Loose or missing teeth. 
Tips for pet dental care 
Begin dental care at home by feeding your pet specially formulated foods that 
help with dental health. 
Schedule regular veterinary checkups to ensure that your veterinarian can 
monitor your pet's dental progress. 
Do not use toothpaste made for humans as it can cause an upset stomach. 
Give your pet appropriate toys to prevent teeth fractures. 
Don't wait for an annual checkup if you suspect a problem.

Brush and floss after every meal, brush your tongue to get rid of bacteria 
and bad breath, then follow up with mouthwash. 
These are some things our dentists tell us to keep our teeth healthy, but 
animals need dental care, too. 
February is National Pet Dental Health Month and advocates say pet owners can 
become more educated on the importance of taking care of their pets' teeth. </content>
