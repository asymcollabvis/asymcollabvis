Person County now has an animal cruelty investigator who will be able to 
investigate allegations of animal cruelty and abuse as well as promote and enforce 
animal health and well-being. 
On Friday, Feb. 13, Butch Setterington was sworn-in by Clerk of Court Debra 
Barker as the county?s animal cruelty investigator. County commissioners 
formerly appointed him to the unpaid, volunteer position on Feb. 2.
With the assistance of city and county law enforcement, as well as Person 
County Animal Control, the newly-appointed investigator is authorized to 
confiscate animals when necessary and offenders can be prosecuted in court.
State law authorizes the board of county commissioners to appoint animal 
cruelty investigators to serve without compensation. Animal cruelty investigators 
shall serve a one-year term and take the oath of office required of public 
officials.
The position has always been available, explained Animal Control Director 
Ronald Shaw, but up until now employees of Animal Control staffed the position.
But with Setterington assuming the volunteer station, employees? time will be 
freed-up so additional staff duties within the department can be attended, 
Shaw said.
?Obviously, we will go out there and look first,? said Shawm referring to 
the initial steps taken when Animal Control receives a call or report of abuse, 
neglect or cruelty. If the call turns out to be legitimate then the case can 
be handed over to the cruelty investigator, he said.</content>
