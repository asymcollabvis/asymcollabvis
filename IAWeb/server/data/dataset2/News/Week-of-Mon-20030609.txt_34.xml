Avian veterinarians have known for decades that Teflon-coated and other
non-stick cookware can produce fumes that are highly toxic to birds. As
early as 1986, a Chicago-area expert on "Teflon toxicosis" called the
phenomenon a "leading cause of death among birds," and estimated that
hundreds of birds are killed by the fumes and particles emitted from
Teflon-coated products each year [1][2]. Although an accurate national
accounting of deaths is not available, in a single year this Chicago
veterinarian documented 296 bird deaths in 105 cases involving non-stick
cookware.

Under ordinary cooking scenarios, Teflon kills birds. A review of the
literature and bird owners' accounts of personal experience with Teflon
toxicosis shows that Teflon can be lethal at normal cooking temperatures,
with no human lapses in judgment or wakefulness.
