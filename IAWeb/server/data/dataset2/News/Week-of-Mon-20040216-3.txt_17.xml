Mad cow disease must now be considered "indigenous to North America," and
the United States can no longer consider its first mad cow "an imported
case," says an international scientific panel advising the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA). At a USDA public hearing in Riverdale, Maryland on
Wednesday, the five member panel said that while the dairy cow found to be
infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Washington state
last December was imported from Canada, it probably was not the only one.
"It is probable that other infected animals have been imported from Canada
and possibly also from Europe," the panel warned. "These animals have not
been detected and therefore infective material has likely been rendered,
fed to cattle, and amplified within the cattle population, so that cattle
in the U.S. have also been indigenously infected." Their report advises
that United States should test many more cattle, implement the rapid
screening tests for BSE used in Europe, and exclude brain and spinal cord
material from all human and animal food, including pet food.

Said Michael Hanson, a scientist with Consumers Union, the organization
that publishes Consumer Reports magazine, "There's plenty we don't know.
But the USDA takes the science that will cause the beef industry the least
trouble and basically ignores the rest." Sleep well. </content>
