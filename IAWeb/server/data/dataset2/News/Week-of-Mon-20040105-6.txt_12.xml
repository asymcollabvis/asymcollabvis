Good morning. Ah, there's good news in the town that most people have to 
spell with a cheat-sheet: Waxahch, uh, Wasahach, uh, Waxahachie! 
In April, a bunch of do-gooder/animal nuts (high praise in my world) formed 
the Ellis County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
The organization is not affiliated with any other SPCA but does adhere to the 
goal of protecting animals. 
Now the nonprofit EC SPCA is caught up in a building campaign called "Waise a 
Woof!" says executive director Diane Dynis. The proposed $155,000 facility 
will have 55 inside dog kennels, six kennels with outside runs, a cat "condo" 
and other critter features. (Make donations to EC SPCA Building Fund, 800 N. 
Highway 77, PMB 138, Suite 160, Waxahachie, TX 75165. Call the EC SPCA at 
972-935-0756.) The EC SCPCA also needs "in-kind" donations ? building materials, 
skills and office and critter equipment. 
On Monday, the EC SPCA, paid $2,000 for a 2.3-acre "spread" formerly owned by 
the county at 2570 FM 878 on the east side of Waxahachie. (We'll keep you 
posted about the groundbreaking ? check Larry Powell's Pet Blog at 
www.dallasnews.com.) 
Now, as is tradition for animal people, turn to each other and chant our 
mantra, "If I win the lottery, there won't be a homeless dog or cat in Texas." </content>
