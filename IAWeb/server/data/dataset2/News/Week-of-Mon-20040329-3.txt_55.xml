Consumer Alert went undercover into the Warehouse Outlet in the Quakertown 
Farmers Market -- a large grocery store that advertises low prices. They found 
low prices, but they also found a lot of expired products like a bottle of 
Kraft Catalina salad dressing, dated Oct. 24, 2003; Butterball sliced deli turkey, 
dated Feb. 12, 2004; packages of hot dogs dated from Dec. 9, 2003; and nonfat 
Kraft Miracle Whip dated March 5, 2003. 
The owner of Quakertown Warehouse Market, Richard Woldrow, said he stands by 
his products. 
"If someone doesn't want to buy a six-month-old bottle of mayonnaise which 
has an indefinite shelf life for $1, they can always buy one for $1.50 that is 
in code. It happens to be the same product -- no degradation," Woldrow said. 
Dr. Stanley Segall is a professor of food sciences at Drexel University. 
Consumer Alert asked him to take a close look at all of the items we bought. 
"You can see the beginnings of separation. This is a emulsified product. 
Yeah, you could shake it up, I suppose and it would look all right. But again, 
this a fat product, and it's not going to taste very good -- the fat goes 
rancid," Segall said. 
"Old products are only old in terms of a calendar date. The manufacturers 
don't feel them to be old," Woldrow told Consumer Alert.</content>
