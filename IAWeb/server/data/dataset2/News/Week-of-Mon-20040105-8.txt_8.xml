Jim Rickert was struggling to meet the demand for his organic beef even
before mad cow disease became front-page news.

Now, as consumers hear more about the disease and how it is spread, the
rancher is flooded with orders.

"The calls started coming right after the news got out," said Rickert,
general manager of Prather Ranch, one of California's largest organic and
grass-fed beef producers. "People seem more interested in what cattle are
eating."

It's been two weeks since a cow in Washington state was diagnosed with the
disease, and Rickert said demand keeps growing. The Prather Ranch Web site
warns that it could take a month to fill orders.

Mad cow can go undiagnosed for years, and it kills cattle and people. It
spreads as cattle eat their diced peers in feed mixes and calves are fed
bovine blood. The protein-rich feed can pass the disease from a dead cow
to a live one, and on to consumers.
...
Chickens, which aren't susceptible to the disease, are fed protein meal
that includes cattle parts. The concern is that poultry litter --
including undigested protein meal, feathers and manure -- is fed to
conventionally raised cattle. Pet food, which can include bovine meat and
bone meal, also is fed to cattle.

Organic cattle are not allowed to consume either type of feed.

The two standards are sparking interest in organic beef, according to
Rickert, because his animals eat a vegetarian diet.
...
"I've been eating organic beef, so I'm not eating hormones or pesticides,"
said Carl Sacco, a 45-year-old Modestan and co-owner of Cornucopia Natural
Foods. "Now, with mad cow, I'm convinced it's the way to eat."</content>
