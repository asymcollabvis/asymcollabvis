SAN FRANCISCO -- The fate of the San Francisco Zoo's two surviving elephants 
brought heated debate to a Board of Supervisors City Services Committee 
meeting this morning. 
Two elephants at the zoo have died in the past two months heightening 
concerns from animal activists and zoo officials about the well-being of the other 
elephants living on zoo grounds. 
Both sides are in agreement that the elephants named Lulu and Tinkerbelle 
should be relocated to a larger outdoor facility where the animals will have more 
room to roam. 
Newly hired Zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo announced the zoo's intention to 
move the elephants at today's meeting and said the elephants would probably only 
return to the zoo if a greatly expanded facility for them could be 
constructed. 
Mollinedo said he would like to see the remaining elephants moved within the 
next six months, pending approval of a new home by the American Zoo and 
Aquarium Association. 
According to Mollinedo, the association's approval is necessary in order for 
the zoo to remain accredited. 
Activists, including members of In Defense of Animals and the city's Animal 
Control and Welfare Commission, took issue with the zoo's six-month time frame, 
and with the zoo's willingness to let the AZAA choose the elephants' new 
home. 
Board President Matt Gonzalez, explaining the activists' point of view, said 
that there is "a sense of urgency" about the issue, because many feel that 
conditions at the zoo led to the other elephants' premature deaths and could lead 
to the same fate for the remaining two.
