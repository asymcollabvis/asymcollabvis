  <content>This week, Ed Teal ran headlong into the brick wall that animal 
control in Delaware County has become.
Teal, a Yorktown-area resident, believes wild dogs have killed several of his 
chickens and ducks. Teal this week captured one of those dogs in his barn.
But his sympathies soon turned toward the dog, which was obviously starving 
and had a large growth on its neck.
So Teal tried to get help for the dog from the Muncie Animal Shelter and the 
Delaware County commissioners, who could only suggest that he take the animal 
to the Randolph County Animal Shelter.
"Everybody was telling me to go to Randolph County in this subzero freezing 
rain," Teal said. "There was just a lot of hoops to jump through."
Finally, Teal contacted Animal Rescue Fund, which arranged for local 
veterinarian John Boyce to take the dog in and, if necessary, euthanize it. But Teal 
had to get the dog on a leash and get the animal to the office first.
"All I wanted was some help," Teal said. "It's not my dog, but I wanted some 
help with it.
"Good grief, a county with more than 100,000 people can't afford a van and 
can't afford to hire someone to catch dogs and they're telling people to go to 
Randolph County in bad weather?"</content>
