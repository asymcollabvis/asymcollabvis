AMES, Iowa - The temperature has dropped to 4 below, and the vast campus
of Iowa State University is a snowy, sullen ghost town. Professors and
students alike are away on winter break. It is not a promising time or
place to drum up votes.

Rep. Dennis Kucinich doesn't seem to notice, or care. Arriving late, a
two-aide entourage in support, the little-known Democrat from Ohio starts
firing away the moment he hits the overheated basement meeting room of the
Collegiate United Methodist Church.

"This campaign has picked up a lot of momentum!" he declares
enthusiastically to the crowd of about 85.

Kucinich then lists the particulars of what he calls his "holistic world
view." If he were president, he says, he would replace U.S. troops in Iraq
with U.N. troops, within 90 days of taking office, and pay reparations to
Iraqi families.

He would cut the Defense Department's budget by 15 percent and establish a
Department of Peace. He would repeal the North American Free Trade
Agreement and withdraw the United States from the World Trade Organization.
...
Yet, among those who gather to hear him, Kucinich inspires enormous
enthusiasm. He attracts the true believers who were devoted to Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, but are looking for an alternative within
the Democratic Party.

In Kucinich, a vehement opponent of the war in Iraq, a critic of the
mainstream media, and a fervent advocate of free education, single-payer
health care, workers' rights, environmental protections, and legalized
marijuana, they have him. The man is even a vegan.
...
He worked as a TV reporter, a radio talk show host and a lecturer. In
1982, his income totaled $38. Along the way, two marriages failed. He
became a vegan, eating a diet free of animal products.</content>
