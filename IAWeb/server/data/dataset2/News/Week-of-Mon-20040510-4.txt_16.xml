VANCOUVER, British Columbia - A Canadian immigration panel is considering
whether accused environmental saboteur Tre Arrow can apply for refugee
status in Canada.

Arrow, 30, who is wanted for fire bombing logging and cement trucks in
Oregon, asked the Canadian authorities to remain in Canada as a political
refugee at a hearing in Vancouver on Tuesday.

A key issue will be whether Arrow is affiliated with a terrorist group,
which would immediately disqualify him from receiving refugee status in
Canada, authorities said.

The Immigration and Refugee Board is scheduled to decide by May 31 whether
Arrow is affiliated with the Earth Liberation Front, a group the FBI
considers a terrorist organization responsible for scores of attacks on
property over the past dozen years.
