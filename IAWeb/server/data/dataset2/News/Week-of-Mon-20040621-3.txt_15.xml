Douglas County officials expressed disappointment Wednesday with the outcome 
of Bob Stirton's trial on 31 counts of animal neglect.

Commissioners and other officials were pleased with Stirton's conviction 
Tuesday on all 31 criminal accounts. However, they weren't happy that, for at 
least the time being, Stirton will be allowed to maintain ownership of the dogs 
being cared for at the Saving Grace Pet Adoption Center in Winchester.

"We knew we probably weren't going to get much money out of him, but we 
wanted a forfeiture order so we could make arrangements for those dogs to be 
adopted," Commissioner Dan Van Slyke said.

The county is providing the nonprofit shelter an additional $3,000 a month to 
care for the 30 dogs in its custody. That amounts to a little more than $3 a 
day per animal. The dogs, along with another one that died in March, have 
remained at the shelter on Del Rio Road since Dec. 23.

The expense for the dogs belonging to Stirton, who had resided in the Drain 
and Curtin areas but who now lives in Cottage Grove, is in addition to the 
regular $5,500 monthly subsidy provided to Saving Grace for the entire shelter 
operation. The cost of caring for Stirton's dogs represents more than half of the 
normal subsidy.
