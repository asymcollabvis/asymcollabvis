The public is invited to attend the Sunday session of the "Nights of 
Champagne and Tropical Fish" at the Miami Beach Convention Center
to celebrate the finest in drink and marine life. Highlighting
the evenings's activities will be the mega-auction of rare bottles of 
champagne and exotic species of freshwater fish, some in alluring
combinations.

"Saturday night was invitation-only, Sunday is open to the public,"
reports Arthur Swordane, operations manager of the show for its
sponsor, Global Ways importers.  "We pair a Veuve Clicquot Grand 
Dame Rose with a large Jardini Arowana right off the bat on Sunday
...watch for it." 
...
Saturday night festivities brought out such notables as socialite
Luella Vedric and musician r'Bert, who were special guests of Global
Ways owner Madhi Kim.  It is said both are looking to add to their 
current tropical fish collections, as well as their wine cellars.
