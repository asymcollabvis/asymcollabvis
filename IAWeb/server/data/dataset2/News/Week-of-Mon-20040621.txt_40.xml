FORTUNA -- A local member of the national animal rights organization People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said she and others are planning to mount 
a protest when a traveling circus comes to town next week. 
The Carson and Barnes Circus mistreats their performing Asian elephants, PETA 
alleges. 
However, a spokeswoman for Oklahoma-based Carson and Barnes hotly disputed 
this allegation, as did a spokeswoman for the Fortuna Sunrise Rotary Club, which 
is bringing the circus to town. 
The circus will be at Rohner Park in Fortuna on Monday, June 28, and in 
McKinleyville the following day. 
Kate Raynor is a Fortuna resident and PETA member who said she and other 
local members of the animal rights group will be at Rohner Park the day of the 
circus, possibly dressed in costumes, to demonstrate and educate the public about 
Carson and Barnes' treatment of its elephants.
"These are unnatural acts these animals do and they're trained with cruelty," 
Raynor said. 
The intense travel is extremely difficult for circus animals, who lead 
unnatural lives of solitude, she said. 
"There's no veterinary intervention at any of these stops," Raynor said. 
"It's pathetic," Raynor said of the animal performances. "People have walked 
out."
