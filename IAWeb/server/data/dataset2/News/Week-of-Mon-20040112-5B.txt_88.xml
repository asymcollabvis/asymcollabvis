I would like to respond to a letter that appeared in your Nov. 21 edition 
entitled, "Trapping may be legal, but is it moral?"

Like many articles condemning hunting, trapping and even fishing, it is over 
dramatized and under factualized. The author correctly states that leg hold 
traps are legal on private land, and I bet the owner is having a problem with 
the loss of livestock due to predators. The main predators that threaten 
livestock in Rhode Island are foxes and coyotes, neither of which could be caught in 
a conibear, or quick-kill traps as they are often called. They are far too 
wary.

The author has lost pet cats, and I truly do sympathize with the loss of a 
pet, they are like members of the family. However, I wonder if she is aware of 
the fact that all of those missing pet posters she see are largely the result 
of coyote attacks, far more than those caught in traps, legholds or otherwise. 
Additionally, if she is such an animal lover, why are her pets free to roam in 
such a dangerous environment as opposed to the safety of her own property?
