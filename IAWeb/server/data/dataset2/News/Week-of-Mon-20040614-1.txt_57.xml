State Agriculture Commissioner Don Ament says his agency is accustomed to 
keeping an eye on cattle, horses and other farm animals.
But mean, nasty, just-plain-bad dogs?
That's something new. 
But it's what the state Agriculture Department will have to do beginning July 
1.
A bill signed into law by Gov. Bill Owens requires the department to keep a 
statewide dangerous-dog registry.
"This is really a different deal," Ament said. "I don't know of any other 
states that do this."
However, he said implanting identifying chips in pets and farm animals is an 
idea that's been growing nationwide. "If this keeps up, I wouldn't be 
surprised if we're going to be identifying everything that moves with a chip."
The new law requires that a microchip permanently identifying a dog as 
dangerous be implanted at the owner's expense following a conviction for owning a 
dangerous animal.
The veterinarian or licensed shelter that implants a microchip has 10 days to 
notify the Agriculture Department's Bureau of Animal Protection. Prior to the 
microchip being implanted, the dog owner must pay a $50 dangerous-dog 
microchip license fee to the bureau.
According to early estimates in the bill, of an estimated 5,600 dog bites 
annually in Colorado, 1,400 will be prosecuted and 467 will be required to pay 
the fee.
