Dear Friends,
I have just read and signed the petition:
Ban Fur-Farming in Sweden!
http://www.thePetitionSite.com/ 
This year, Sweden is very close to finally banning fur-farmning - a barbaric industry which kills 1.3 million minks every year in Sweden alone. You can help to put pressure on the Swedish Government to take swift action for the fur-bearing animals.

It takes only 30 seconds and will really help. Please follow this link to our petition:
