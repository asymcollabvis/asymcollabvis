  <content>A dozen endangered sea lions gather around two 
divers waving strange contraptions far below the ocean surface off the coast of 
Kodiak Island. 
    Brian Fadely, a federal wildlife biologist, grips a noose attached to a 
50-foot line, while colleague Kate Call wiggles a herring at the end of a short 
pole to lure one of the hefty pups through the hoop -- successfully. Another 
curious Steller sea lion is caught for science. 
    Five researchers in a skiff are ready to crate the startled 200-pound 
animal for the short ride to the research vessel Tiglax, the only ship of its 
kind among the 540 national wildlife refuges in the country. 
    Once on board the ship, scientists with the National Marine Fisheries 
Service anesthetize the 5-month old pup, glue a satellite transmitter to its 
back, then release it back to the frigid sea to be tracked over the next several 
months. 
By the end of the 17-day excursion from Kodiak to the eastern Aleutian 
Islands last month, researchers will have tagged 13 young sea lions, believed to be 
the most vulnerable age group of an endangered species off Alaska's coast. The 
ongoing juvenile tracking effort has intensified over the last few years, but 
there's always one constant -- the Tiglax. </content>
