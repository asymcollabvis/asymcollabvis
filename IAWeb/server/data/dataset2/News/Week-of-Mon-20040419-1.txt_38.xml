Two more Japanese nationals have joined the growing list of wildlife poachers 
nabbed by Cape conservation officials while trying to smuggle wildlife or 
indigenous plants out of the country.

This week Terutoshi Terada and Masato Araki were each convicted in the 
Vredendal Regional Court of three charges under the Cape Nature Conservation 
Ordinance for poaching tortoises and other reptiles, and sentenced to a fine of R110 
000 or four years in jail.

The pair were arrested in Vredendal on March 14, and were found in possession 
of five angulate tortoises, 51 armadillo girdled lizards, one Karoo girdled 
lizard and one Bribron's thick-toed gecko.

These reptiles are all protected in terms of the conservation ordinance, and 
are also listed in Appendix 2 in the Convention for the International Trade in 
Endangered Species, which means any trade in these species is strictly by 
permit only.
