The Jan. 7 editorial, "Factory Farm Issue Changing," was confused when it 
suggested that fast-growing poplar trees might be "the solution" to the health 
and environmental problems created by "smelly, noxious manure lagoons" here in 
Pennsylvania. 
The closing down and cleaning up of inactive manure slurry impoundments in 
North Carolina presents quite a different set of challenges than the problems 
associated with an active factory farm that is generating thousands of gallons 
of animal waste on a daily basis. When a concentrated animal facility is in 
operation, ground water contamination, stream pollution and respiratory ailments 
are well documented and ongoing concerns. 
Unfortunately, these issues are not changing and have come to plague 
Pennsylvania. Although the Press Enterprise has not covered these stories, a manure 
spill from a massive hog operation in nearby Perry County contaminated the 
borough of Blain's community reservoir, rendering the water supply undrinkable and 
forcing residents to switch to bottled water. Also, the state's largest 
chicken farm, located near Gettysburg, polluted waterways by spreading manure on top 
of snow that was then washed directly into streams by heavy rains.</content>
