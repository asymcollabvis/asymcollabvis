      Traffic jams along I-15 in Murray are a headache for commuters, but 
they are a boon for homeless pets.

"Kimi" flips a switch at unveiling of new electronic sign for the Humane 
Society of Utah last spring. Since then, monthly adoptions are as much as 25 
percent higher than year ago.
      More abandoned canines and felines in Utah have homes these days thanks 
primarily to a new billboard message sign for the Humane Society of Utah that 
fronts I-15 at about 4200 South.
      Last year was the best-ever adoption year for the Humane Society, with 
6,128 pets going to new homes ? the first time the number has exceeded 6,000 
in a single year.
      Gene Baierschmidt, executive director of the Humane Society, attributes 
most of the adoption success to that new sign.
      "We have a captive audience some days," he said, when the freeway 
becomes a parking lot and thousands of motorists see homeless pets pictured in full 
color on the electronic sign. The fact that the Humane Society office, 4242 
S. 300 West, is located near the freeway also helps.
      The electronic sign was installed in May, and since then the Humane 
Society has seen monthly adoption increases as high as 25 percent more than a 
year ago, Baierschmidt said.
      The national pet adoption average for U.S. Humane Societies is about 25 
percent. Utah's rate is now approaching 80 percent.
      In addition to the new publicity from the sign, Baierschmidt attributes 
some of the success to the No More Homeless Pets in Utah campaign.</content>
