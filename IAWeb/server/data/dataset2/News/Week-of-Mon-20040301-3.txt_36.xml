The University has seen many interesting phenomena in recent years,
including half-naked men with masks peering into windows and irate
preachers toting 20-foot signs declaring the damnation of the entire campus.

But an even more perplexing phenomenon has been the suicidal ideation of
the campus squirrels.

The squirrels' quiet scurrying remains at the Capstone, but the power
outages, damaged electrical equipment and thousands of dollars worth of
damage have somehow discontinued this year.

Why have the squirrels' desperate, life-ending cries for help ceased?

Danny Glover, division operations manager at Alabama Power, said much of
the squirrels' salvation is due to the intervention of squirrel guards and
rodent blocks, part of the company's reliability effort initiative.
...
Grant Hiatt, a member of the Alabama Animal Rights Fellowship, said that
like the meat industry, it is obvious that animal health and safety is
closely related to humans' health and safety.

A perfect example of that principle is the past squirrel problems on
campus, he said.

"Sure, it would be expensive to squirrel guard, but the benefit for
de-squirreling [electrical equipment] outweighs the cost," he said. "The
squirrels are an integral part of the Quad, and I am sure they have been
in recruitment literature. We should do our part and make sure they are
not electrocuted."

Hiatt said that when he reflects on the mindset of a squirrel, he thinks
of young children and how they must be sheltered and protected from
dangers in the world.</content>
