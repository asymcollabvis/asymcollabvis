  <content>Colorado Animal Rescue (CARE) rescued 30 cats from a house in 
Parachute Feb. 5, after their owner died.
CARE received a call that afternoon from the Parachute Police Department 
asking for help in rescuing ?a lot? of cats from the home of a man who had died, 
said CARE executive director Leslie Rockey. 
Parachute police found the cats when they discovered the man?s body, said 
Rockey.
?We filled the cars,? Rockey said, and told police, ??Meet us there at 6.??
When Rockey and Heather Martin, a kennel assistant, opened the front door of 
the house, the cats swarmed around them.
?As soon as we walked in they were all there, meowing and crying at us,? she 
said.
?It was a mess,? said Rockey. ?It was a very poor living environment.?
All the cats were sick, some pregnant, and living in their own feces, said 
Rockey.
Rockey and Martin immediately started plucking cats from the floor and 
putting them into the kennels they had brought with them from the Spring Valley 
shelter. 
?I?ve never seen anything like it,? said Martin. ?It was like picking 
apples,? she said of putting the cats in the kennels.</content>
