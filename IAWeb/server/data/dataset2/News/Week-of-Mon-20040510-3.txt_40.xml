Mother's Day greetings were delivered early this year to three local moms
? with love from the federal government. In lieu of cards, FBI agents
hand-delivered subpoenas ? demanding that the women comply with the most
coercive of judicial investigations: the grand jury.

Jennifer Woodruff and Twiga May-Whittier have been subpoenaed as part of
an ongoing investigation into the Romania auto arson that brought Carla
Martinez and other activists before the grand jury more than two years ago
(see EW archives 1/17/02). Heather Whitney, the mother of a newborn, has
been subpoenaed to testify as a witness in Seattle as part of an
investigation the Washington US Attorney vaguely referred to as crimes
committed in the name of animal rights and/or environmentalism. 
...
But, according to government attorney Engdall, whether a person is a
mother is "irrelevent. The grand jury doesn't target people based on their
economic or social status. It invites people to come and present
documentation or testimony concerning a criminal investigation," he says.
...
"I can only wonder why they would call single mothers to testify,"
questions Woodruff. "I feel as though it is because we have so much more
at stake and that is one of the dirtiest, most unethical things that a
government can do to its own people."
