ST. PAUL - An animal-rights group wants the city of St. Paul to purse
legal action against a circus company in the death of an acrobat who
died during a performance last month.

In a letter to City Attorney Manuel Cervantes, an executive for People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals cites a state law dating to the
1800s that requires acrobats to perform with a safety net.

Lisa Wathne, PETA's captive exotic specialist, called on Cervantes to
investigate. The statute calls for a $250 fine if a safety net is not
provided. A violation is a gross misdemeanor.
