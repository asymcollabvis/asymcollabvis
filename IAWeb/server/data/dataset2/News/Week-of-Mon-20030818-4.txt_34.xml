Bashing Gophers and Slaughtering Cats and Dogs

Buckner learned that by the time Keith Jesperson was six, he had gotten his 
first taste of killing living things by bashing in the heads of gophers 
while still in British Columbia.  By the time he was twenty, while living 
with his parents in the Washington State trailer park, Keith got his first 
taste of killing larger animals when he began dragging stray dogs and cats 
into a field near the park where he would beat them to death with a shovel, 
strangle them with his bare hands, or shoot them with his BB gun.  He 
discovered that he enjoyed it.

Nowadays, it’s no secret that those who have shown a propensity toward 
animal violence and abuse during their younger years sometimes move on to 
more violent crimes later on in life that are directed at human beings.

“It’s in the crime journals of all major law enforcement agencies,” 
Jesperson once wrote from his prison cell at Oregon State Penitentiary, 
where he eventually became a permanent resident.  “Abusive behavior towards 
animals is one of the symptoms on the road to being a murderer.”
More on his animal abuse can be found in I: The Creation of a Serial Killer
by Jack Olsen. Below is an excerpt from a review:

"Olsen lets Keith Hunter Jesperson narrate the whole book from a first 
persons point of view. It is a chilling, brutal, scary tale. Its almost too 
vivid as he describes torturing animals (Animal lovers beware. I'm one and 
its upsetting)"</content>
