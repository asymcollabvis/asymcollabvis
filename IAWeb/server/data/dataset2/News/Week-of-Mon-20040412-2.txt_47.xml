It's a scene that's hard to believe, and Ford Motor Co. says it didn't
want anyone to see it in the first place:

A small black car is parked in a suburban British driveway, accompanied by
the sound of birds chirping. A ginger-colored cat wanders up, and the
car's sunroof suddenly slides open. The cat climbs up the hood and
windshield to investigate, pokes its head into the sunroof . . . and the
sunroof draws shut, slowly beheading the cat.

The tagline says, "Ford Sportka, The Ka's evil twin."

The 40-second video is an Internet-only advertisement for a small Ford
hatchback sold in Britain. Except that Ford has disowned the ad, claiming
that it rejected the spot as too extreme and did not approve its release.

How the video wound up e-mailed around the world over the past few days is
something of a mystery. Animal rights advocates in the United Kingdom have
condemned it in the British press, and Ford's ad agency -- Ogilvy &amp; Mather
-- is conducting an internal investigation to figure out what happened. </content>
