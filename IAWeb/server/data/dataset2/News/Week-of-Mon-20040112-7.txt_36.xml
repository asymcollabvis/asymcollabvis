If every dog has his day, Doc has had his and then some.
News of the dog's saga of abuse and perseverance sparked outrage and requests 
to adopt the Wisconsin pooch.
It also has prompted a flood of calls to the Pierce County district attorney, 
a surge in adoptions at the Humane Society of Pierce-St. Croix and questions 
about why we care so much about what happens to a 6-month-old black 
Labrador-Dalmatian mix.
"We've had other animal abuse cases, but I don't ever recall anything getting 
this kind of attention," said Pierce County Sheriff Everett Muhlhausen.
Doc's stint in the limelight began earlier this month, when misdemeanor 
charges were filed against three Pierce County men accused of throwing the puppy 
out the window of a car traveling 80 mph last Halloween. The men then allegedly 
kicked the dog when they saw he had survived.</content>
