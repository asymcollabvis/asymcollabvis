A small but visible group of about 20 Smoky River rural residents opposing 
factory farms and supporting family farms gathered in front of Dunvegan MLA 
Hector Goudreau?s office in Falher last Friday to demonstrate their displeasure 
with the Province of Alberta government?s policy and position supporting factory 
farms.

Residents from throughout the region, and one from as far away as Fairview 
converged on the MLA?s office for the event hosted by Friends of an Unpolluted 
Lifestyle (FOUL), a group of property owners in the Municipal District of Smoky 
River who formed FOUL last fall to strengthen their forces to express their 
opposition to the Province of Alberta having complete control in locating and 
regulating confined feeding operations and intensive livestock operations.

However, the MLA was in Grande Prairie for the day as guest speaker to unveil 
the new logo for the new promotion of Branding the Peace, a commitment he 
made several months ago, Goudreau told the Express.

(For reaction from MLA Goudreau, turn to page 2.)

?We were pleased with the turnout for a first-time event and we received much 
support from the people we talked to,? says Tony Flowers, president of FOUL.
