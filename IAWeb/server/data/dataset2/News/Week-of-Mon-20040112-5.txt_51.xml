A person gets the "mad cow" disease by eating the infected tissue of a
slaughtered animal. Abnormal proteins in the cow's flesh distort normal
proteins in the human brain and nervous system. The disease begins making
small holes throughout the human brain, causing an infected person to
first suffer hallucinations, followed by blindness and epilepsy and
eventually suffer total loss of faculties. The infected person will then die.

Animal rights groups, concerned citizen organizations and some lawmakers
have begun to step up pressure on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to implement stricter cattle-monitoring procedures such as those in place
in Japan, where every cow to be slaughtered is tested for disease, and
animals are not fed the remains of others-the main way "mad cow" is spread
among livestock.

Officials at the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) recently released a
statement saying that commissaries did not receive any beef from the herds
now under quarantine.

"No beef in any of our 275 commissaries worldwide has been involved in a
USDA recall," said Col. Mark Wolken, chief of public health, safety and
security for DeCA. "The USDA has stated that the U.S. beef supply is safe
and that the beef recall resulted from an abundance of caution, not fear
that the meat is infected. Should the USDA make a determination that there
is danger, DeCA would be the first to react to protect the health of our
customers," he said. </content>
