Two horses graze at the G and L Ranch on Dayton Road. Authorities suspect a 
combination of disease and crowded conditions killed four horses recently at 
the ranch. 




Fast Facts 
The organism that causes "strangles" is streptococci equi. It is highly 
contagious and spreads from horse to horse by either direct contact or when an 
infected horse is introduced to the herd, said Dr. Julie Carson, an area 
veterinarian. 
Streptococci equi only affects horses, cannot be spread to humans and is not 
necessarily fatal, Carson said. 
The organism causes fever, pain in the jaw and abscesses around lymph nodes 
under the jaw, she said. Streptococci equi itself does not cause the horse to 
die, but the conditions it causes can lead to death, she said. 
Infected horses should be isolated, fed last and kept in clean stables. 
Caretakers should decontaminate water, feeding buckets and any other items that 
come in contact with infected horses, she said. 
A vaccine is available by injection or nasal spray, she said. 


Crowded conditions, under-feeding and a highly contagious infection known as 
"strangles" may have caused the death of four horses at a Newark farm, 
authorities said. 
Other animals were found in emaciated condition. 
Animal control officils are investigating Lisa Fallon, 48, who has 32 horses 
and numerous other animals at the G and L ranch, 1346 Dayton Road, said 
Licking County Animal Control Director Jon Luzio. 
Fallon said the herd was stricken with "strangles" during the winter and 
refused to comment further. Fallon told investigators one recently purchased 
horse, now deceased, was infected and spread the organism to nearly every horse in 
the herd, Luzio said. </content>
