The introduced feline species is a despised outlaw in a unique native 
landscape. 
Local legend has it the creatures grow to panther-like proportions and stalk 
the Tasmanian bush like crazed killing machines. 
The predatory aliens kill birds and other wildlife -- and are so good at it 
they leave nothing for the native carnivores. 
The feral cat is known as a vermin and pest. 
Animals Australia spokesperson Glenys Oogjes says the hatred, however, is 
causing pain and suffering. 
Ms Oogjes says once an animal gets branded a pest or vermin it gives some 
people the green light to hate the animal and treat it with disdain. 
"Animals Australia wants to change the prevalent perception that introduced 
wild animals have to be killed and it doesn't matter how," she said. 
"Introduced wild animals do not suffer any less than any other animal but 
they are subjected to some of the most extreme forms of cruelty imaginable. 
"They can lawfully be poisoned, starved, burned, gassed, shot from 
helicopters, killed in snares and subjected to germ warfare." </content>
