A PRETORIA couple will soon be the proud parents of a bouncing cloned baby 
girl . This is the fantastical claim of Dr Brigitte Boisselier, head of the 
infamous reproduction company Clonaid and a bishop in the Ra?lian Movement, which 
believes space aliens created humans through cloning. 
"We believe that one day we will be able to use cloning technology to grow a 
body in a few minutes, " says Boisselier, in SA to promote the movement's 
philosophy and espouse the benefits of human cloning. 
In addition to checking the progress of the Pretoria clone Boisselier says 
the mother is three months pregnant she is meeting prospective customers and 
political leaders, whom she declines to name. 
She says she has met health ministers from several, again unnamed, African 
countries but is not planning to meet Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang 
on this trip. 
Las Vegas-based Clonaid triggered worldwide attention 18 months ago when it 
claimed to have cloned two human babies, a girl called Eve born to an American 
couple, and another girl born to a Dutch lesbian couple. 
The claims were met with increasing scepticism and condemnation as Boisselier 
steadfastly refused to provide details of where the babies were born, or 
evidence that they were exact genetic replicas of their mothers. 
Scientists such as Harry Griffin, head of Scotland's Roslin Institute, which 
cloned Dolly the sheep, dismissed the claims as a "publicity stunt". 
Boisselier says she has not published proof of the 13 cloned babies she has 
helped create because she "fears for her safety".
