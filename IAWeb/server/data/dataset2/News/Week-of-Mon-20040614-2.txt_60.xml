St. Johns County Animal Control is investigating a couple of incidents at Pet 
Paradise Resort where one dog was injured and another killed in attacks by 
other dogs. 
"At this point, these are mishaps until further investigation reveals 
otherwise," said Paul Studivant, supervisor of Animal Control. "We're investigating 
possible animals that could have had records in the community with aggressive 
behavior." 
Studivant spoke with the State Attorney's Office on Friday afternoon for an 
initial briefing on the issue. "This could end up being a civil issue between 
pet owners and the business," Studivant said. 
Fred Goldsmith, president of America Pet Paradise, which owns Pet Paradise 
Resort, said the attacks are tragic, but very rare. Out of 150,000 dog visits in 
the facilities in St. Augustine and Palm Coast, he said there have only been 
a half a dozen problems where a dog might have gotten into a fight or 
accidentally injured another dog while playing. Only two dogs have required stitches, 
he said. 
"We spend our entire lives trying to provide a clean, safe environment for 
our animals," he said.
