An Animal Defenders International Rescue Team has traveled
to Zimbabwe and secured a CITES confiscation order from the 
Ministry of Agriculture for four tigers, six lions, and an 
African Python from Assan Circus. Ten dogs and two horses 
were also seized on welfare grounds. These animals were handed 
into the care of Animal Defenders International who are currently
seeking new homes.  A. Hassan, owner of the circus, has apparently
fled the country and cannot be located.

If you have any information about Mr. Hassan or the circus, please
contact Animal Defenders International.
