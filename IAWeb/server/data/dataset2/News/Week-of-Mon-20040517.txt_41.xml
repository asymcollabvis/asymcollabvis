The term "downed" needs to be better defined when it comes to cattle, says 
Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont. 
In the midst of the "mad cow" controversy last December, the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture banned the slaughter of downer cattle, animals unable to stand 
on their own. 
Sick cattle should not be allowed in the human food supply, but the rule 
shouldn't apply to animals unable to stand due to other physical ailments, such as 
having a broken leg, said Rehberg. 
Rehberg introduced legislation last month that would allow cattle "downed" 
due to a list of physical conditions, such as broken limbs or temporary 
paralysis after calving, to be slaughtered and processed for human consumption. 
H.R. 4121, being sent to the House Agriculture Committee, is backed by the 
Montana Stockgrowers Association. 
"We would not support any action that would allow unhealthy animals into the 
food chain," said Steve Pilcher, executive vice president of the Montana 
Stockgrowers Association. "What this does is better define exactly those animals 
that might pose a human health risk." 
Under Rehberg's proposals, cattle that show signs of a central nervous 
disorder can not be slaughtered for human consumption. That includes bovine that 
stagger or downers with no identifiable physical problems.
