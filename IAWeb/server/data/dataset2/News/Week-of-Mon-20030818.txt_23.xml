So-called animal rights activists who squeal to authorities
disgust me, and I think one of the major reasons the animal 
freedoms efforts have not made substantial progress is because 
many activists do not picture the truly progressive nature 
of this movement. We're fighting evil, defending the 
defenseless and our very own earth from greed and destruction. 
There is no room for those working both sides of the fence. 
...
We have thousands prepared to take action for us ... 
The offspring of those we fight are enjoying comforts sapped 
from the life and abuse of innocent animals. Why should they be 
allowed to shelter themselves from that and sit in front of their 
TVs and stereos when animals die because of the actions of 
their parents? 
...
I once heard Collie Carnes (director of the Society for the 
Prevention of Mistreatment of Animals or SPOMA) say getting 
arrested is fun.  I can't say that I agree.
...
It is ill-advised to have even the most innocent of discussions
with any law-enforcement, FBI, or Homeland Security agent.
