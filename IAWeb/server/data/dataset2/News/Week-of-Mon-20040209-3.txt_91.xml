Illegal logging is destroying the equatorial rain forests of Indonesian 
Borneo, bringing the island, once known as the lungs of Asia, to the brink of an 
ecological disaster. 
Not only has 95 percent of the forest legally set aside for logging been 
cleared but nearly 60 percent of protected national parkland has been illegally 
logged, according to a new report in this week's Science by professor Lisa M. 
Curran of the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies.

"Already, what is left (of the forest) is too small and too fragmented to 
support many of the species that depend on the forest," said Curran, director of 
the Tropical Resources Institute at Yale University. "For the first time we 
have seen large mammals, such as orangutans and Malaysian sun bears, wild boar, 
starving." 
There are more than 420 different birds and 222 mammal species in Kalimantan, 
half of which depend on the rain forests for survival. Furthermore, the 
indigenous people of Borneo, the Dyaks, depend on boar as a primary source of 
protein. 
"Clearly the animals are in crisis," said Curran. "In Gunung Palung National 
Park in West Kalimantan, for example, the orangutan population will drop by a 
third in the next couple of years." </content>
