  <content>There are two things you don't want to see being made,"
German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck reputedly said. "Sausage and
legislation." The mad-cow episode in the United States illustrates that
quip as no other story in recent memory.

Americans today are learning far more than they ever wanted to know about
the process of turning cows into thousands of products that even a
hard-core vegan would have trouble avoiding - cosmetics, pharmaceuticals,
fire-extinguisher foam, lubricants, the glue that holds plywood together.
Not to mention the steaks, roasts, hamburger, and other meat items that
human carnivores regularly devour.
...
"Excluding cattle brains, eyes, spinal cord, and guts from the human food
supply is certainly a step in the right direction," says Michael Greger, a
medical doctor who studies BSE for animal rights and consumer groups.
"Unfortunately," he adds, "the US still feeds those potentially risky
tissues to pigs, pets, and poultry."

At the same time - more bad news for those who'd rather not know the
origins of their sausage - the litter from chicken coops (grain, feathers,
and manure) still can be swept up and fed to cattle under the new
regulations. "The major concern in feeding rendered cattle remains to
other animals," says Dr. Greger, "is that the cattle remains may directly,
or indirectly, find their way back into cattle feed, which could
potentially spark a British-style outbreak of mad-cow disease."</content>
