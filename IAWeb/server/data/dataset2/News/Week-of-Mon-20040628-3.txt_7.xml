WASHINGTON The
U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Wednesday a cow that initially
tested positive for mad cow disease has come back negative on follow-up
testing, but a food industry consultant told United Press International
he estimates there could be more than 100 cases of the deadly disorder
in the country's herds.

About half of the cases will go undetected and passed on for human
consumption, Robert LaBudde, president of Least Cost Formulation Ltd., a
food industry consultancy in Virginia Beach, Va., told UPI.

The USDA is still awaiting results from another case that initially
tested positive Tuesday. Results could take four to seven days. Under
the agency's expanded surveillance plan, which went into effect June 1,
cows initially are screened by so-called rapid tests and any positives
are followed up with confirmatory testing. The only confirmed U.S. case
of mad cow disease to date occurred in Washington state last December. 
...
LaBudde, who has served on the faculties of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thinks
there will be many more infected cows detected.

"There is no question that we will be seeing a dozen or more -- possibly
100 or more -- cases of BSE-positive cattle in our national herd," said
LaBudde, whose clients include the meat industry.
