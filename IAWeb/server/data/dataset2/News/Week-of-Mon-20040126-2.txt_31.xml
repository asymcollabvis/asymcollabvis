In a tidy neighborhood marked with a sign promising "Tranquil Country 
Living," a waif wrapped in a brown sweater took her first tentative steps inside her 
new home. 
As she grew bolder, she jumped on a bed, nibbled at food and stepped lightly 
through the fenced back yard. 
This dog's life looks a lot different from what it did just weeks ago. 
Donner arrived at the home of Mimi and Jim Parker on Friday, the first of 47 
Italian greyhounds to be adopted after their removal from a squalid house on 
the Northwest Side. 
Ten more dogs left the Humane Society SPCA of Bexar County later that day, 
and the rest are expected to find new homes as well. 
Mimi Parker, 51, of San Antonio, took the day off from work to acquaint 
Donner with the house and the family's other Italian greyhound, Blitzen. 
Less than an hour after Donner sat trembling in Parker's lap at the shelter, 
the 4-year-old dog pranced through the kitchen, dancing on hind legs for dog 
treats. 
"I've never seen her wag her tail that much," Parker said. 
Until Jan. 9, Donner lived in a house so filthy that city animal control 
workers wore respirators while seizing dozens of dogs, most of which were locked 
in plastic pet carriers, said Eddie Wright, a city animal cruelty investigator. 
Wright said the house was nearly dark and that "you couldn't walk without 
stepping into something." 
Through an attorney, Jamie Daily later relinquished custody of the dogs at a 
municipal civil hearing, Wright said. 
The Humane Society waived the $4,200 cost of the dogs' medical care, but 
Daily was assessed $1,720 in administrative fees to the city for collection of the 
animals.</content>
