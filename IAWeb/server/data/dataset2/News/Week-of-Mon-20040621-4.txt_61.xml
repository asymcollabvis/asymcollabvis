The auction was supposed to mark the end of a highly publicized animal
cruelty case, which left one man sentenced to a year in jail and 40
emaciated horses to rehabilitate in Taylor County.

Instead, many bidders at yesterday's auction were horrified to learn
that more than a dozen of the horses would be returning to the same farm
where they once starved.

Among the 100 people who attended the auction of 45 saddlebred and one
walking horse yesterday morning near Bradfordsville were the two sons of
John Humphress, the man found guilty of 47 counts of animal abuse.

"It nauseates me that they are here," said Julie Size, who traveled from
Plantersville, Texas, to attend the auction.

The court prevented Humphress from attending the auction, but he stood
on a nearby road during the auction and communicated with his sons, John
Jr. and Clif.
