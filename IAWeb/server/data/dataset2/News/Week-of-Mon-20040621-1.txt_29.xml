POLICE are investigating an animal rights activist group after
shareholders in Montpellier, the construction group building a new drugs
research laboratory for Oxford University, received threatening letters
in the post. Shares in Montpellier crashed by 19 per cent yesterday
after investors received a letter ? purporting to be from Roy Harrison,
the company?s chairman ? threatening ?prompt activity by the animal
rights movement? unless they sold their shares. The stock ended the day
at a four-year low of 18p, down 4?p.

The letter is aimed at derailing a new ?18 million animal testing
laboratory which Montpellier is building for Oxford University. Walter
Lilly &amp; Co, a subsidiary of the group, is leading the project, and
activists are hoping to force the company to pull out by targeting
shareholders of the group. 
...
It is not known exactly who is behind the campaign. Speak, a prominent
representative body for animal activists, did not return phone calls
yesterday.

The activists will be hoping to replicate the success of SHAC, the Stop
Huntingdon Animal Cruelty organisation, which helped to push Huntingdon
Life Sciences, the Cambridge-based drug testing company, to the brink of
collapse. In January 2000 SHAC began a campaign which targeted the
company and its financial backers, including shareholders, bankers and
City institutions such as market makers and stockbrokers. The company?s
share price, which was 22p at the start of 2000, quickly fell by about
65 per cent and continued to fall for the next two years, to stand at
3.25p at the end of 2001, when the company moved to the US and relisted
in New York.
