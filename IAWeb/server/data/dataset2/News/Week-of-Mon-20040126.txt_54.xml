  <content>Kosher World Conference &amp; 
Expo, the international tradeshow for expanding kosher markets, comes this week 
to the prestigious Los Angeles Convention Center for its inaugural event. 
Showing off the future of kosher, from healthy meat to dairy-free to Halal and 
other ethnic food groups, Kosher World is demonstrating that kosher is one of 
the world's largest brands. 
Mike Schall -- former President &amp; CEO of The B. Manischewitz Company and 
Guiltless Gourmet, and with positions held at Wise Foods, Lawry's Foods, and 
Carnation -- kicks off the event with his much anticipated forecast of the Kosher 
industry potential in the next few years. 
With thousands already pre-registered to visit the show, nearly 100 
participating organizations in exhibit hall, 18 conference sessions (many of which 
accredited by the American Dietetic Association or approved by the American 
Culinary Federation for continuing education), Kosher World is set for not only a 
fabulous inaugural expo, but a world class conference. 
"Kosher does so much for so many -- not just the ethnic markets, but 
vegetarians, and those looking to avoid dairy -- that it was time for a world class 
event to show off all the benefits of kosher," said Neil Ticktin, CEO of Kosher 
World. "Our exhibitors demonstrate and sample products. Our speakers educate 
in our world class conference track. And, our attendees will walk away with an 
understanding that nearly everyone can find benefit in kosher products."</content>
