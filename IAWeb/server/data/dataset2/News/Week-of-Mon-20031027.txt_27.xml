  <content>If all the cats and dogs in Jefferson County only knew 
what kind of party is about to be thrown for them. 
This coming Sunday, more than 400 items ranging from Tiffany glass to a 
dinner for four with television political commentator Jack Germond will be 
auctioned Sunday at the Clarion Hotel and Conference Center in Shepherdstown. 
The auction, which organizers hope will raise more than $30,000, will be used 
to help pay for operating the Jefferson County Animal Welfare Society and 
Spay Today, an organization that helps people spay and neuter pets at a reduced 
cost, organizers said. 
The Jefferson County Animal Welfare Society, an animal shelter along Leetown 
Road, has been struggling with finances and accommodating large numbers of 
unwanted pets.
