It's two o'clock in the afternoon - do you know where your pet is? Or better 
yet, what the critter is up to?
It's likely Fluffy is tearing up the carpet or Fido is chewing on the sofa. 
Maybe Bowser is protesting your lengthy work day and the lack of attention he's 
receiving.
Animal psychologists would tell you the finicky pets just need some love.
Aberdeen pet sitter Suzette McQuillen might agree, but she also knows that 
the animals want some food and dogs especially require a bathroom break.
McQuillen, owner of four cats and one puppy, started Paws &amp; Claws Pet Sitting 
in 1998 based on this premise.
She now belongs to Pet Sitters International, a worldwide trade organization 
for folks in the cat- and dog-sitting business.
"Pet sitting has definitely taken off," said Sheila Smith, spokeswoman for 
Pet Sitters International, a King, N.C.- based organ- ization.
The industry has grown even during the recent turbulent economy, Smith said. 
The organization has 5,800 members nationwide, three in South Dakota.
Smith said pet sitting gives people an alternative work choice - one that 
they enjoy.
"My whole life I've loved animals," McQuillen said.
The business started with an idea McQuillen had during a Maine vacation in 
December 1998. She said her friends had five cats and worried who would care for 
them while they traveled.
"I thought, 'jeez, what if I looked out for people's pets,' " Suzette said.</content>
