Neither the word "bikini" nor "barbecue" springs to mind, but here I am at
a place called the Lucky 13 Art Studio out on Bayou St. John, about to
witness a vivid underground spectacle called "Sweet Meat," in which local
performance/conceptual artist Heather Weathers will weave a bikini out of
freshly butchered red meat, model it and then grill and serve it to her
audience.
...
For the last performance of Sweat Meat (this is the 13th show since its
inception), Weathers got regular flank steak from Sam's Club in Kenner and
she invited the guy in the bloody apron behind the counter to her
performance and he said he'd come but, well . . . she didn't see him there
that night.
...
"I use the idea of a meat bikini to present this idea in a simple
non-intellectual form. It allows the viewer to experience the animal
instinct of attraction and repulsion. I am interested in the dichotomy of
the live skin and dead flesh . . .The performance is a ritual. I am able
to exchange these ideas by offering them to the audience. It is your
choice to partake or not of the flesh."
...
As Weathers disrobes from her gown and applies her meat bikini, she says:
"The texture of red meat is very surreal -- soft, supple and wet." The
photographers move in.

She says: "I'm very sensitive to the fact that I'm wearing something dead." 
...
She offers me some. She is a vegetarian. That's what I choose to be at
this moment. Besides, there's no horseradish.</content>
