Noble, an Akita, was adopted on a Monday and returned to Fort Worth's animal 
shelter on a Wednesday. The adopter said he couldn't afford a big dog.

Art Tawater sees it almost every Christmas.
A hurried parent or grandparent, having put off holiday shopping till the 
last minute, drops by the Arlington animal shelter and picks up a cute puppy or 
kitten. The gift is a big hit with the kids on Christmas morning.
But a few days later, the dog has chewed the carpet, the kitten has clawed 
the furniture, and the pet's sleeping quarters stink.
Tawater, Arlington's animal services supervisor, says that's when some 
recently adopted pets are returned to the crowded shelter.
"Unfortunately, the animals are adopted on a whim, just like people go out 
and buy things on a whim every holiday season," he said. "And it's not good for 
the animal."
So far, few holiday gift animals have been returned to the Arlington shelter 
or Fort Worth's animal shelter. But it's bound to happen, as it does almost 
every year, officials said.</content>
