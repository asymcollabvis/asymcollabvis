Someone found a puppy suffering from bad wounds to his neck in Jasper County, 
and investigators want to know who did it. The now happy-looking puppy is 
anywhere from three to five months old, but for most of his life he's been 
wearing a collar much too small, leaving a deep gouge around his neck. 
"The sad fact is his skin grew around the collar which created a great deal 
of infection, loss of blood supply, and some pretty significant secondary 
complications," said Stacy O'Quinn, a veterinarian with the Riverwalk Animal 
Hospital.
O'Quinn took the puppy in Wednesday, when Jasper County Animal Control first 
found him. She says it's not the worst case of animal abuse she's seen, but 
this puppy's hurt pretty bad. 
Today, veterinarians are going to take the dog into surgery. They're going to 
have to cut off clumps of dead skin and basically sew his neck back together.
"This is a situation where somebody put a collar on a dog that was young and 
they either neglected or forgot they had a dog or the dog got loose and was 
not approached for some time, and obviously dogs can grow and collars can't 
grow," said O'Quinn.
