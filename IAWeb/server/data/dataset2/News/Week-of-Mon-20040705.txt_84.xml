      For the first time in nearly 50 years, Maryland's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Governor Robert Ehrlich have announced that they will open a bear hunting season this fall. The announcement comes after legislative attempts to stop the hunt failed by just one vote. 
      The bear hunt is a terrible idea for several reasons. First, because the current Maryland bear population is so small (somewhere between 266 and 437, according to the DNR?s own estimates), any kind of trophy hunt would be biologically reckless. (Just fifty years ago black bears were protected from hunting after they almost went extinct in Maryland.) Second, a random bear hunt will not diminish human-bear encounters -- a specific, aversive conditioning program for individual ?problem? bears is needed. Hunters are likely to kill bears that are far away from human dwellings; these bears are not likely to have ever caused damage near human populations. Third, state law already permits the DNR to shoot and kill specific individual bears thought to be causing damage near human dwellings. There is simply no scientific evidence to support the DNR's claims that hunting is either necessary or even likely to reduce damage.
