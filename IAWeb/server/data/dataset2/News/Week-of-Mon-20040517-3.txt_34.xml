A look at apparent greenhouse gas effects reported by scientists and other 
observers:

Oceans

Seas rose throughout 20th century, and over past decade they rose at 
accelerated rate of one-tenth an inch (0.25 centimeter) per year. Levels are rising 
because water expands as it grows warmer and because of runoff of melting ice 
from continents.

Islands 

Islanders in the Pacific and elsewhere report steady erosion of shorelines 
from rising seas. Some small, low-lying islands have vanished beneath waves.

Arctic

In late summers, ice over the Arctic Ocean is believed to be only 60 percent 
as thick as a few decades ago. It is believed to cover 10-15 percent less area 
than it did at that time.

Animals

Birds, seals, polar bears, and other northern animals could be severely 
affected by the shrinking of Arctic ice, their habitat. Biologists find polar bears 
are losing weight because of reduced hunting time on ice.

Tundra

Spring temperatures in the Alaskan Arctic were as much as 7 F (3.9 C) warmer 
in 2000 than in 1971. Permafrost ? tundra ? is melting, buckling roads and 
damaging other infrastructure. Shrubs have moved into treeless areas.

Glaciers 

Mountain glaciers beat a widespread retreat in nonpolar regions during the 
20th century. Some European glaciers have shrunk by 50 percent. Only 27 glaciers 
remain of the previous 150 in Montana's Glacier National Park.

Snow

Global snow cover is believed to have decreased by 10 percent since satellite 
observations began in the 1960s.
