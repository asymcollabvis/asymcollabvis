The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) is the 2003 recipient of 
the American Association of Equine Practitioners' (AAEP) Equine Welfare Award, 
the Lavin Cup. Named for AAEP past president A. Gary Lavin, VMD, the award is 
presented annually to a non-veterinary individual or organization that has 
demonstrated exceptional compassion or developed and enforced rules and guidelines 
for the welfare of the horse. The award was presented during the AAEP's 49th 
Annual Convention in New Orleans, La.,on Nov. 24.
The PRCA was selected for the Lavin Cup because of its dedication to 
protecting the health of the animals that participate in its events. The PRCA has made 
tremendous strides in recent years in uniting the rodeo industry regarding 
animal welfare issues as well as establishing detailed animal-use guidelines. To 
ensure the welfare of the animals, the PRCA employs a full-time animal 
welfare coordinator to administer its welfare program and regularly convenes the 
Humane Advisory Committee to review animal welfare issues. The PRCA also 
established a Veterinary Advisory Committee in 2001 and requires that a veterinarian 
be onsite at all PRCA-sanctioned events to inspect all animals prior to 
performance and to provide any needed onsite health care.
"It is a terrific honor and we are very humbled to be awarded the 2003 Lavin 
Cup," said Steven Hatchell, commissioner of the PRCA. "This is a testament to 
the hard work, leadership and guidance of many, including the PRCA Veterinary 
Advisory Committee, PRCA Humane Advisory Committee, rodeo veterinarians 
throughout the country and our own Cindy Schonholtz, animal welfare coordinator."</content>
