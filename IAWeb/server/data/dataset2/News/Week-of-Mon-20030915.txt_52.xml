  For the first time, the British Columbia
Automobile Association's (BCAA) Insurance Agency will be offering a product
exclusively designed to provide security and peace of mind for its members'
four-legged friends. The new CAA-branded pet health insurance, aimed at
providing pet owners with easier access to insurance, is being piloted
exclusively in B.C. before being rolled out by other CAA-affiliated auto
clubs.
    According to a research study conducted by Pet Plan Insurance - BCAA's
pet insurance provider - one in three pets will experience a new illness or
injury requiring veterinary care this year, with one in six pets sustaining
two or more illnesses or injuries.
    "When a pet is injured or gets sick, the resulting vet bills can result
in a huge financial burden which sometimes isn't manageable," says Suzanne
Milino, BCAA Manager of Insurance Product Development. "With this insurance,
pet-loving BCAA members will be able to increase their peace of mind at a
level that suits their budget."
    Three different levels of coverage are available under this plan:
Compact, an accident-only plan; Intermediate, an accident and illness plan
that offers $2,500 of coverage per year; and Luxury, a second accident and
illness plan that offers $4,500 of coverage per year.
    "Pet health insurance helps to promote the highest quality care and
reduces instances of economic euthanasia, which is a heartbreaking decision
for any pet owner," said Dr. Ian Sandler, Rosedale Animal Hospital in Toronto,
Ontario. "We have seen that for many pet owners, this type of insurance allows
us to provide a higher level of care for their pets than they might have
afforded on their own."
