Anya Zartman jokes about becoming the Vegan Goddess of the area, 
but she is serious about being a vegan. 
The 25-year-old became a vegetarian when she was 11 years old. She switch to 
a vegan diet -- first and foremost for ethical reasons, she said. 
Zartman never had a school lunch from the sixth grade on. The transition was 
fairly easy, she said: "I just packed my lunch." 
Zartman didn't feel like an outsider, munching on vegetables while of the 
other kids were chomping down burgers. 
"In school everybody just kind of expected (that of) me," she said of her 
peers' perception of her. "Oh that's Anya," she said -- she was kind of outspoken 
and political anyway. 
Plus, both of her parents were very receptive to her being a vegetarian. 
She began to embrace the existence more throughout high school and college as 
she read about the impact of vegetarianism on health and the environment. 
She learned the encompassed much more than health. 
Connecting with other vegans has been a plus of being on a college campus. </content>
