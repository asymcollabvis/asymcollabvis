The Maryland Department of Natural Resources last week accepted an offer of 
$75,000 from the Fund for Animals and the Humane Society of the United States 
to mitigate bear and human conflicts. However, the DNR rejected the animal 
rightists' stipulation that the proposed bear hunting season in Allegany and 
Garrett counties be canceled. 
    Let me make it clear that what I'm about to comment on is my personal 
opinion. Allow me to recall an old western Maryland fishing partner, Gene Moon, 
who used to say, "If you sleep with dogs, sooner or later you're going to have 
fleas." I suggest that the DNR heed Moon's advice. 

    Agreed, the DNR serves all the people in Maryland, not just hunters, 
anglers and trappers. But, folks, if you enter into an unholy alliance with people 
whose objective is to stop all hunting and fishing, you're no better than 
they are. 
    That's what worries me. I'll wager the well-heeled Fund for Animals and 
the Humane Society are having parties right now, celebrating the fact that they 
got a foot into the door of an agency that regulates all the hunting and 
fishing of an American state.
