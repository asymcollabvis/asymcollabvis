  <content>Paris has the boulevards. Rome has the fountains. But here, well, 
they've got the pigs. 
Lots of pigs. Big ones. Wild ones. They don't call them pigs, of course. 
Here, they're called Wildschwein, which translates to wild pigs, or wild boars. 
And they're all over the news these days. 
Look in Der Tagesspiegel and there's a picture of a momma boar, OK, a sow, 
suckling five piglets. She's resting against the passenger side wheel of a 
sedan, which is parked in front of an apartment building. A few days ago, in 
southwestern Berlin, a 54-year-old man encountered a boar, of all places, hiding 
under his dining room table. The boar bit him when he tried to shoo it away. 
Boars are not cute creatures. Typically weighing between 200 and 300 pounds, 
they can be aggressive, using their five-inch tusks as weapons ? especially 
females with litters. 
Berliners like to say their boars rarely attack, and many residents put out 
food for them or don't complain as they root through a city park or private 
garden. Some note that the boars line up outside doors, like pets, waiting for 
their meals. 
That has meant closer encounters with human residents. In recent months, 
they've been spotted in the center of what was old East Berlin, Alexanderplatz. 
"There were two of them, hunting for food," said Marc Franusch of the Berlin 
forest administration. "They had some people worried." </content>
