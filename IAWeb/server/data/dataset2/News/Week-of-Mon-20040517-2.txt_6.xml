  <content>The Detroit Zoo will become the nation's first major animal
facility to give away its elephants solely on ethical grounds.

Winky and Wanda, the latest in an 81-year-old tradition of pachyderms at
the zoo, will be sent to one of two U.S. refuges this summer or early fall.
...
Even though the Detroit Zoo is "head and shoulders above" other zoos in
terms of animal treatment, the decision was the right one, said Debbie
Leahy, captive-animal specialist with People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. "He's the first one to say elephants don't belong in zoos."

Detroit's elephants might go to the Tennessee sanctuary, which by year's
end will have 2,700 acres of fenced land for them to roam. Or, they might
go to a similar sanctuary in California, the Performing Animal Welfare
Society preserve.
