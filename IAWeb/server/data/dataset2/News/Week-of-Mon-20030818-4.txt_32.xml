Bread. Pasta. Rice. You might blame them for your weight gain. Or you may 
have heard someone blasting them on the news. Contrary to popular belief, 
though, carbohydrates are not necessarily the enemy.

Carbohydrates are found in grains, vegetables and legumes (complex 
carbohydrates) as well as in fruit, milk and other dairy products (simple 
carbohydrates). It's how much you eat of these foods - or any other type of 
food - that matters when it comes to weight gain. "At the end of the day, 
weight gain and loss is a matter of calories. If you eat more calories than 
your body can use - be it from protein, carbohydrate or fat - you will gain 
weight," says Karen Miller-Kovach, MS, RD, Chief Scientist at Weight 
Watchers International.


So why do carbs - and not fat-laden butter or cheese - have such a bad 
reputation? First, carbohydrate-based foods today are often super-sized. 
While a regular Lender'sÂ® Bagel weighs 2 ounces, many New York-style bagels 
from the corner deli can weigh 4 to 6 ounces, and more. And servings of 
pasta at many restaurants far exceed the 1 to 2 cup portion that should be 
the norm.

Plus, eating a meal that consists mostly of carbohydrates, like pasta with 
tomato sauce, may leave some people feeling hungrier sooner...

.........
Choose a variety of carbohydrates. Fruits, whole grains and vegetables 
contain a wide range of disease-preventing substances. Maximize your health 
quotient by choosing a wide variety of items from these food groups.
