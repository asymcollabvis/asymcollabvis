Nineteen horses, nearly all of them unkempt, hungry and wild-eyed, were taken 
from a farm north of West Salem on Wednesday, three days after authorities 
found a stallion dead in a muddy corral.

Four llamas also were taken away.

Two women living at the farm, LeeAnn Lucas, 46, and Gail Solberg, 45, were 
cited on one count of second-degree animal neglect, a misdemeanor, said Sgt. 
Eric Shepherd of the Polk County Sheriff?s Office.

Lucas and Solberg could face more charges after a veterinarian examines the 
animals today, Shepherd said. The women are scheduled to appear in court Feb. 
12.

If found guilty, they would be forced to give up the animals. Meanwhile, 
authorities hope to place the animals in foster homes.

Shortly after 11 a.m., a caravan of vehicles, including a handful of trucks 
pulling horse trailers, stopped in the fog in front of the farmhouse on Oak 
Knoll Road NW where Lucas and Solberg live. Deputies served a search warrant at 
the house.</content>
