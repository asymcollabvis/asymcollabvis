More and more, people are willing to do just about anything to take their 
pets on family trips, no matter how far. And hotels, eager to cash in on a market 
they once disdained, are responding with packages and amenities designed to 
attract pet owners.

"There's an incredible demand for it," said Steve Pinetti, senior vice 
president of sales and marketing for San Francisco-based Kimpton Boutique Hotels. 
"The emotional connection that one has with one's pets is akin to having 
children. I would be willing to bet that in some cases the connection is even 
greater."

Hotels and resorts are jumping in, and there are even travel agents who deal 
solely in pet travel. One airline will allow pets to travel in the main cabin 
with their owners when it begins flying this year.

A poll taken by the Travel Industry Association in 2001 showed that about 29 
million Americans traveled with their pets in the previous three years. In a 
recent study commissioned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, 76 percent of dog 
owners said they would be more loyal to a hotel chain that accepted dogs, even if 
they weren't traveling with their dog. Those numbers have translated to a 
greater acceptance of dogs (and cats) than a decade ago, when most front-desk 
clerks were likely to turn up their noses at the mere suggestion of a pet 
spending the night.</content>
