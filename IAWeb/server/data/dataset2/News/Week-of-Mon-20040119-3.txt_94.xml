While surrounding communities are grappling with a growing stray-pet 
population, the animal welfare group that runs the Princeton-area animal shelter has 
its own plans to deal with the problem. 
Faced with a growing number of unwanted pets and an expanded need for its 
services, the Princeton group called SAVE has embarked on a $5 million 
fund-raising campaign to build a new state-of-the-art facility. 
The building would be nearly eight times larger than the existing shelter at 
Herrontown and Mount Lucas roads in the township - growing from slightly more 
than 4,000 square feet to about 32,000 square feet. 
"There is no reason to think the (human) population is not going to keep 
growing, and that means more pets," said Sara M. Nicolls, SAVE's executive 
director. 
"It's abundantly clear to our board that we have not been keeping up. Our new 
facilities will serve the community now and 20 and 30 years down the road." 
SAVE, an acronym for Small Animal Veterinarian Endowment, expects to take its 
site development plan for a $3.5 million structure to the township planning 
board for review in April, Nicolls said. 
"We are truly out of room," she said. "To do our work as it should be done we 
need to add many components for a user-friendly environment. We have an 
obligation to step up and do it according to up-to-date standards."
