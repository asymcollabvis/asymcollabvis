When Portsmouth photographer Marianne Pernold 
Young went to photograph Peter Rice with his four cats, he told her that the 
black one was skittish. 
"He told me not to get near that cat," Pernold Young recalled. "But I started 
playing with him. As I was leaving, I noticed him curled up in my camera 
bag." 
Young will bring her newest photo essay, "Celebrating the Human/Animal Bond," 
to the N.H. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals just in time for 
the holidays. After a private reception Dec. 3, the exhibit will be open to 
the public in the SPCA lobby until the end of January. 
According to Pernold Young, photo essays are her forte. She?s done them on 
fishermen, Portsmouth businesswomen, Seacoast "movers and shakers," and she?s 
working on one on pregnant women. People and pets seemed a good fit. 
The exhibit was the brainchild of Pernold Young?s friend Pat Crawford of Rye, 
a longtime SPCA volunteer. Last spring Crawford spearheaded the first "Art 
for Animals" exhibit. Local artisans brought work that was mostly 
animal-related, and showed it at a wine and hors d?ouevres party at the shelter. Half the 
profits went to the artists and half to the SPCA. 
"We made $16,000 in one afternoon," Crawford said. 
Crawford is known around the SPCA for thinking outside the box. he also 
established Andy?s Fund, an endowment for animals with serious medical conditions. 
As she chatted and Pernold Young hung her work, Buddy, a one-legged dog who 
benefited from Andy?s Fund, wandered around the lobby. </content>
