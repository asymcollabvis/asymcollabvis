A Chinese chef fired from 12 different jobs over his refusal to cook wild
animals was given a special award by conservationists last week.

And, odd though it may seem in a country boasting one of the
fastest-growing economies on the planet and one of only three nations
capable of putting people into space, that?s a remarkable story here.
...
Sceptics this week are saying the country has more chance of getting a man
on the moon in that timeframe than it does protecting the basic rights of
animals. To the dismay of the small band of activists here, last week also
saw the dramatic suspension of historic animal welfare draft legislation
that would, for the first time, have provided legally enshrined rules on
animal wellbeing.

The draft, published on the local government?s website for public
consultation ? before being withdrawn four days later ? included specific
requirements on raising animals in captivity, guarantees of decent living
conditions, methods of transportation and slaughter.
...
Wuhan-based legal expert Qiao Xinsheng voiced what many think: ?As soon as
you talk about animal rights, you?re talking about money. Our farms are
small, poorly ventilated buildings. Our slaughterhouses are not modern.
How can you expect a farmer in China to copy the West?
