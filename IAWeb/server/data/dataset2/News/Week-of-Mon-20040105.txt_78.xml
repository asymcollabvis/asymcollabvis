Reflections of a mad cowboy  
If you're as alarmed as I am about Washington's mad-cow case, then you know 
precisely why the disease must be stamped out without an instant's 
hesitation: To shut the gobs of insufferable vegetarians here. Especially 
the ones who wear leather. One of mad cow's most horrifying symptoms is to 
make these people even more self-righteous than usual. In a just ecosystem, 
they would begin to stagger after eating veggie burgers with those fake 
grill marks. Silly Cow Disease. (Incidentally, I plan to have my next New 
York strip cut into the shape of a zucchini.) Take note of my bovine field 
research: During the WTO riots, I found myself interviewing one of the lead 
protesters in their headquarters. He seemed ill at ease, so I tried an 
ice-breaker. "Pez?" I said, holding out the dispenser.
