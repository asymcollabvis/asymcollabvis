It wasn't just that Edward Baker allegedly bashed the cat in the face. Or 
that he chased it around the blood-spattered laundry room. Or that he 
extinguished cigarettes on another cat's paws. 
It was, authorities said, that he acted methodically, intentionally. 
That's why the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is putting 
national focus on the Macomb County case, said Daniel Paden, a cruelty caseworker 
with the animal rights organization. 
"These malicious, deliberate acts -- these acts don't bode well for the 
future," Paden said. 
Paden recently wrote Macomb County Prosecutor Carl Marlinga, urging him to 
"vigorously prosecute" Baker of Clinton Township by demanding jail time and 
psychiatric counseling. 
Paden said the Norfolk, Va., organization sees hundreds of cases a week in 
which people mistreat or kill animals. 
But the organization only writes about 10 letters a week demanding that 
prosecutors act. </content>
