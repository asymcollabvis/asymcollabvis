Alisa Harrison has worked tirelessly the last couple of weeks to spread
the message that bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, is
not a risk to American consumers.

As spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Harrison has helped
guide news coverage of the mad cow crisis, issuing statements, managing
press conferences and reassuring the world that American beef is safe.

For her, it's a familiar message. Before joining the department, Harrison
was director of public relations for the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association, the beef industry's largest trade group, where she battled
government food safety efforts, criticized Oprah Winfrey for raising
health questions about American hamburgers, and sent out press releases
with titles like "Mad Cow Disease Not a Problem in the U.S."
...
The Agriculture Department has a dual, often contradictory mandate: to
promote the sale of meat on behalf of American producers and to guarantee
that American meat is safe on behalf of consumers. For too long the
emphasis has been on commerce, at the expense of safety.
...
Yes, the threat to human health posed by mad cow remains uncertain. But
testing American cattle for dangerous pathogens will increase the cost of
beef by just pennies per pound. Failing to do so could impose a far higher
price, both in dollars and in human suffering.
