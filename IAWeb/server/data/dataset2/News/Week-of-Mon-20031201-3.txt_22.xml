Friday, 5 December 2003, 12:28 pmArrested for free speech. BRUCE HUBBARD emailed the local US Embassy to 
protest Bush's invasion of Iraq. He was arrested and charged with causing Offence. 
We think this is a serious threat to free speech in NZ. Under Bruce's bail 
conditions, he must stay 250m away from the US Consulate. Help to create a "Bruce 
Hubbard Free Zone" around the Consulate. Then put on a Bruce Hubbard face 
mask (they will be handed out on the day) and approach the Consulate - let's all 
be Bruce for the occasion! Join Bruce and the Friends of Free Speech for some 
serious fun. Let's make a farce of this farcical - but dangerous - attack on 
free speech. Poster available </content>
