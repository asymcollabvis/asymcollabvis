At first glance there doesn't seem to be anything out of place about
Calendula, a new, upscale natural food restaurant along Southeast
Hawthorne Boulevard. With its tasteful gray and blue paint scheme, the
1891 house-turned-eatery blends in with the nearby art galleries and
natural-fiber clothes shops in the bohemian neighborhood.

Business has been brisk since the restaurant opened Jan. 19. On a recent
evening, formally dressed waiters slip between the small tables covered
with white tablecloths, taking orders and refilling water glasses.

Customers are dining on mushroom-leek lasagna, kale and winter squash
phyllo purse and other gourmet vegetarian dishes, lingering over sweet
desserts and espresso drinks.

To some, however, there is definitely something odd about the restaurant's
owner. Craig Rosebraugh is a local political activist who has spent much
of the past 10 years railing against the evils of capitalism. For much of
the 1990s, the Portland area native served as press spokesman for the
Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front, two underground
groups that have been accused by the federal government of committing acts
of domestic terrorism.

Although Rosebraugh has never been charged with any terrorism-related
crimes, federal law enforcement agents have served search warrants on his
home, and he has been subpoenaed before federal grand juries investigating
acts of ecoterrorism.

More recently, Rosebraugh, 31, wrote and published a book, "The Logic of
Political Violence," that justifies domestic terrorism as necessary to
bring about a long-overdue second American Revolution.

"I'm all for peaceful civil disobedience if it works. But if it doesn't,
people need to take more drastic steps until they achieve their goals,"
Rosebraugh writes.</content>
