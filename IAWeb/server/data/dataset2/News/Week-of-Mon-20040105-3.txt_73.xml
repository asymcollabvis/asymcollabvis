  <content>The county of Miami Dade, Florida can be measured as more than 2,000 square 
miles from South Beach to the Everglade swamps and is filled with millions of 
creatures from Chihuahuas to alligators, but there is only one team dedicated 
to animal emergencies and they are the men and women of MIAMI ANIMAL POLICE. 
For the MIAMI ANIMAL POLICE team at the Miami Dade Police Department Animal 
Services Unit, their city is literally an urban jungle. Join the team as they deal 
with nearly 2,500 calls a month: a loose alligator causes a nine-mile backup 
on the freeway, a python is found in a public restroom and a cult that 
sacrifices animals is discovered. These cases along with many forms of animal abuse 
are explored in MIAMI ANIMAL POLICE premiering on Monday, January 5 from 10-11 
PM (ET/PT). Four more premiere episodes will air from January 6-9 at 10 PM 
(ET/PT). 
MIAMI ANIMAL POLICE follows a team of police officers dedicated to the Animal 
Services Unit (ASU) as they police the 2.2 million people of the extremely 
diverse Dade County area. Based minutes from downtown Miami and on-call 24 hours 
a day, the ASU responds to a broad range of animal situations, from the most 
dangerous and serious cases, to more light-hearted ones. </content>
