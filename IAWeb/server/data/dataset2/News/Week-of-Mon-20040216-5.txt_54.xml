James Woodrow has lived with two kinds of pain for more than a decade. One is 
physical ---- the torture of two debilitating nervous system disorders, 
sometimes so bad "it feels (like) razor blades or battery acid under my skin."

The other is the anguish and indignation the disabled man feels every time he 
walks into a store or restaurant with his service dog, Rocky, and hears the 
words: "You can't come in here with that dog," the 54-year-old Temecula 
resident said. 
While most businesses don't think twice about allowing a blind person to 
bring a guide dog into a store or restaurant, that is often not the case with 
service dogs that assist those with other disabilities, especially when the 
disability is not visible, experts say.

The animals help the disabled in a number of ways. Some are able to detect 
the onset of a seizure, or provide balance to those with trouble moving around. 
Others help those with psychological disorders stay calm. The Michigan-based 
International Association of Assistance Dog Partners estimates that 20,000 
disabled people in the United States use service dogs, including guide dogs for 
the blind and signal dogs for the hearing impaired.
