  <content>A public hearing has been scheduled on a proposed city 
animal-control law, but the plan already is drawing criticism, particularly for its 
three-dog limit per owner and its required registry of pit bull terriers. 
The public can have a say on the proposal at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 27 at City Hall, 
420 Broadway. 
Objection to the law has surfaced already: About two dozen people, most of 
them opposed to the ordinance, attended a recent Common Council committee 
session and asked Rhinebeck resident Mahlon Goer, a member of the American Dog Owner 
Association, to speak for them. 
Goer described the ordinance as "poorly written" and "poorly conceived." 
She said state laws prohibit municipalities from singling out specific breeds 
for legislative action. 
"A breed-specific law punishes law-abiding citizens and their good dogs and 
does nothing to address those people who don't license their dogs, don't leash 
their dogs or control their dogs," Goer said. "That is the basic objection to 
any law that singles out a breed."</content>
