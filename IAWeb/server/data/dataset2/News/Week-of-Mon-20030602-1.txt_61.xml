SENATE OKS ECOTERRORISM BILL

A measure aimed at cracking down on radical environmentalists who sabotage 
farms, timber operations and research facilities won approval Monday in the 
Oregon Senate. The bill passed 23-6 after its chief sponsor, Sen. Ted 
Ferrioli, said environmental vandalism has resulted in $50 million in damage 
in Oregon throughout the past decade. He cited incidents such as the 
firebombing of a car dealership, the torching of a timber company's office 
and the destruction of agricultural research projects, including ones 
involving genetically engineered trees. "Oregon needs a new mechanism to 
deal with the problem of ecosabotage," said Ferrioli, R-John Day.
