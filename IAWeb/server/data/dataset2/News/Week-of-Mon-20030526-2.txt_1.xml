FROM PETA:


Hello New York Activist!Spring is here, but that doesn't mean it is time to 
let down our guardin the war against fur. Instead, PETA is rallying the troops 
for a dayof protest in Manhattan on Monday, June 2nd. That evening, Anna 
Wintour,editor of Vogue magazine and longtime archenemy of the animals becauseof 
her shameless promotion of fur, will be receiving a LifetimeAchievement Award 
from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.To let Wintour and the entire 
staff at Vogue know that compassionatepeople find the cruelty of fur 
inexcusable and outrageous, we'll bepicketing in front of the office all day.Where: 
Conde Nast building (where the Vogue offices are), on 42nd St.between Broadway and 
Sixth Ave, ManhattanWhen: Monday, June 2 9am to 6pmWe'll have morning and 
afternoon shifts of "picketers".holding postersand leafleting at the Vogue office 
building. We'll also have a bignoontime demonstration outside of the office. 
The animals need yourhelp!If you can commit to sparing part of your day on 
Monday to help PETA putthe pressure on Vogue, please contact me as soon as 
possible -we most need people to volunteer a few hours to joinour 
picketers at the Vogue building on the 2nd. If you can only get awayfor 
lunchtime, we still need your help and would love to have you joinus for the noon 
demonstration.It is so important that we make a big stand for the animals on 
this dayand speak out against the greedy few in the fashion industry who 
stillabuse animals for profit. Even if you have never been to a
