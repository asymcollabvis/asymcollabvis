A man claims a woman wrongly adopted his lost 
parrot and he can prove it if given a chance to question the bird in court. 
Loulou, an 11-year-old African gray parrot, flew out of David DeGroff's 
apartment on April 12 after a guest who wasn't wearing her glasses accidentally 
walked into the screen door leading to the balcony.
On May 11, Nina Weaver, of Newburg, Pa., adopted an African gray from the 
D.C. Animal Shelter. DeGroff, convinced the bird is Loulou, filed a lawsuit 
seeking an opportunity to depose the parrot. He is seeking $15,000 for pain and 
suffering if the bird turns out to be Loulou.

According to DeGroff, Loulou's vocal repertoire includes whistling the theme 
song to "The Andy Griffith Show" and saying the phrase "Daddy's gotta go to 
work."
