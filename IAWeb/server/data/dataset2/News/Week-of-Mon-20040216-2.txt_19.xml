Ellen Shillingburg hadn't thought it was possible to feel road rage on the
dirt roads of rural Garrett County, Md.

But when she saw a black bear crossing the road in front of her farm last
fall, Shillingburg barreled toward it in her Pontiac Grand Am.

"I tried to hit it with my car," said Shillingburg, 75, who said bears
killed dozens of her sheep last year on her Oakland property.

"Are you out of your mind?" her husband yelled at her. "It would ruin your
car."

"Yeah," Shillingburg recalled telling him, "but that would be one less
bear we had to deal with."

Black bears were nearly extinct in Maryland 50 years ago, but times have
changed. Shillingburg's experience highlights the anger and frustration
felt by the many Western Maryland residents who support a state plan to
start a bear hunt this year. 
...
But animal-rights activists are fighting back, accusing Gov. Robert L.
Ehrlich Jr. (R) of caving into pressure from hunters more interested in a
trophy bear-skin rug than in wildlife management.

Those opposed to bear hunting have sent thousands of letters and e-mails
to legislators and the Department of Natural Resources. The Silver
Spring-based Fund for Animals is airing a radio ad that pleads for the
hunt to be stopped.

"Even a limited hunt could jeopardize the future survival of this
population in our state," said Michael Markarian, president the Fund for
Animals. "We don't want trophy hunting for this small population of bears."
