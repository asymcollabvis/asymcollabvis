March 23? The name of the Earth Liberation Front used to surface only in 
connection with arson at logging or mining companies, but over the last year the 
group has increasingly claimed responsibility for firebombings at housing 
developments, car dealerships and in people's driveways. Who is this shadowy 
organization? 
What is the Earth Liberation Front? 
The FBI calls it the single greatest domestic terrorist threat, and since the 
mid-1990s the group has claimed responsibility for more than $100 million in 
damages in arson attacks on companies or projects ? and lately, vehicles ? it 
considers particularly damaging to the environment. That is the simple answer 
? but it's not so simple. 
In all of the dozens of "direct actions" that the ELF has taken 
responsibility, only a handful of people have sustained minor injuries, despite all the 
damage done to property. The vast majority of the postings on the ELF Web site 
have maintained a commitment to avoiding injury to people, citing a belief that 
all life is sacred. 
Recently some people who have claimed association with the ELF, including 
former spokesman Craig Rosebraugh, have said that violence against people may 
become necessary, but as of yet the modus operandi of people calling themselves 
members of the ELF has not changed. 
What are they after? 
The ELF is an offshoot of the group Earth First!, created when some 
environmentalists became disenchanted with what they saw as the lack of success of that 
organization and more mainstream environmental groups to have an impact on 
government, corporations and society. </content>
