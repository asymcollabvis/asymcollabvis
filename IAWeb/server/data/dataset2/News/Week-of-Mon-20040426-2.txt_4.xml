New Jersey's Janet Skarbek may very well be the next Erin Brockovich.

This mother and author from claims to have uncovered a cluster of people
who died from mad cow disease in Cherry Hill. The state says she's wrong.
But one thing is certain - Janet Skarbek is stirring up quite a bit of
controversy, reports The Early Show correspondent Melinda Murphy.

That's because public health officials are hoping no one in the U.S. will
ever develop the human form of mad cow disease. They've been on the
lookout since America's first infected cow was discovered last December.
The cow was later found to be imported from Canada, and the U.S.
government says our beef supply is safe.

That's where Skarbek comes in.
