An animal welfare group on Wednesday sought a court order to prevent wolves 
from being shot from airplanes as part of a state-sponsored predator control 
program. 
The Connecticut-based group Friends of Animals, along with seven Alaska 
plaintiffs, sought the temporary restraining order after the state issued three 
permits allowing pilot-and-hunter teams to shoot wolves in the McGrath area of 
Alaska's Interior. 
Superior Court Judge Sharon L. Gleason was expected to decide by the end of 
the day whether to issue the temporary restraining order. The judge also was 
scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether to issue a preliminary injunction 
sought by Friends of Animals to stop the program. 
If that effort fails, the group will call for a tourism boycott of Alaska as 
they did a decade ago when 53 demonstrations called "howl-ins" were held at 51 
cities nationwide, said Friends of Animals president Priscilla Feral. 
"Basically, it is putting the economic screws to the Murkowski 
administration," Feral said of the threatened tourism boycott. 
The first tourism boycott and strong national opposition resulted in former 
Gov. Walter J. Hickel imposing a moratorium on wolf control in 1992. Former 
Gov. Tony Knowles then suspended state-sanctioned wolf killing shortly after 
gaining office in 1994. Current Gov. Frank Murkowski, who took office in December, 
favors lethal wolf control. 
The predator control program for the McGrath area is intended to reduce the 
number of wolves near the town and increase the number of moose calves so that 
there will be more moose for McGrath area residents to eat. </content>
