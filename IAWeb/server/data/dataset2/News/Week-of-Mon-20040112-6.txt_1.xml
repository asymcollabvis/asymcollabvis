The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) appears to be trying to 
sneak one by us again. Seems the no-fishing Marine Protected Areas (MPA) idea 
just won?t die?even though a number of top researchers have professed that 
MPAs do nothing to really advance fish stocks. That is, with one 
exception--establishing a boundary or boundaries that commercial bottom fishers will work 
nonstop. 
SAFMC will hold nine ?informational? public hearings starting January 19 ?to 
collect input from area fishermen (this includes recreational, family-level 
anglers) that may be impacted by the designation of MPAs in federal waters.? 
Rules being considered for these deepwater MPAs include no bottom fishing for 
several species?snowy grouper, speckled hind and golden tilefish. At this 
time, surface trolling for pelagic gamefish such as dolphin, tuna and sailfish 
will still be allowed. </content>
