  <content>More than 450 game wardens, medical workers and volunteers 
wearing fiberglass protective vests and carrying nets, ropes and guns set out 
Wednesday to conduct a tiger census in the Sundarbans delta in eastern India.

The 6,000-square-mile delta, the world's largest mangrove forest, is divided 
roughly in half between India and Bangladesh. Twenty-three teams will pend 
about a week scouring the forest and collecting tiger footprints, traveling 
mostly by boat and doing their best to avoid attack.

"Tigers here are more aggressive because they have to live in a harsh habitat 
of water and mud," Predeep Vyas, field director of the Sundarbans tiger 
reserve, said in a phone interview. "We have to be very careful in doing the work."

The census is part of Project Tiger, a program the Indian government began in 
1973 to stem poaching, which had decimated the country's tiger population. 
Tigers are valued in the booming markets for ancient Chinese folk remedies made 
from animal parts: A tiger's penis is supposed to enhance sexual prowess, and 
its powdered bone is supposed to be useful in treating rheumatism.</content>
