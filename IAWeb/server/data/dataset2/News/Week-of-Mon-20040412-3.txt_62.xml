As fears of mad cow disease rippled across the country three months ago,
the nation's top health official announced stringent rules preventing
farmers from giving cows potentially high-risk feed, saying Americans must
"never be satisfied with the status quo."

But, in fact, the status quo remains.

Despite the urgent tone of that January announcement, the proposed rules
have yet to go into effect, and farmers can use the risky feed with impunity.

Instead, a series of bureaucratic complications and scientific questions
-- prompted by complaints from industry groups and outside safety experts
-- arose within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Review committees
were formed, and they continue to work on issues such as how to dispose of
the prohibited feed.

To become enforceable, the rules must be published in the Federal
Register, a daily compendium of federal government actions. Federal health
officials in January said that would happen in a matter of days. But, to
date, they have not appeared.</content>
