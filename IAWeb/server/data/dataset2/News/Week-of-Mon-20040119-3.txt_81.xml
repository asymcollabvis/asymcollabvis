  <content>The freezing temperatures that have lingered over the area 
for the past couple of weeks have been rough, but those who can?t speak their 
mind about the cold could be in the worst danger. Animals, both wildlife and 
pets, have to rely on humans and their own fur coats to carry them through to 
spring. 
Kim Klippel, operations manager at the Ozaukee County Humane Society, said 
that frostbite is probably the biggest danger to animals, especially on paws and 
ears. She said the risk of contacting frostbite can be reduced by limiting a 
pet?s time outdoors to 10 or 15 minutes.
"Hopefully a lot of people will take care so that we don?t see a whole lot of 
animals being surrendered that have those issues, but some people do need to 
be made aware of it," said Klippel.
Other than frostbite, pet owners should be cognizant of an animal?s body 
temperature. The normal body temperature for both cats and dogs ranges between 
100.5 and 102.5 degrees.
Boots do work
One of the joys of owning a dog is having company on walks, but Klippel said 
if an animal is picking its feet up off of the ground while walking, they 
could be cold and hurting.</content>
