At least three times a week, Tim Heffron rode his bike 20 
miles round trip to the Capital Area Humane Society shelter in Watertown 
Township.
The frequent trips were made easier because of his love for his faithful 
dogs, Angel and Snarfle, whom Heffron surrendered temporarily to the shelter until 
he found a home.
On Monday, Heffron, 46, was reunited with Snarfle, who moved with him to 
Grand Rapids where the man has a new lease on life, a new job and a home with a 
fenced back yard.
"I've never been homeless before, but learned so much from this experience," 
Heffron said. "There are so many opportunities, and every day I see people 
just throw them away."
Angel wasn't part of the reunion. The dog developed cancer and was euthanized 
last month.
"The society took great care for my dogs while I couldn't, even during 
Angel's last days," Heffron said.
The Capital Area Humane Society typically accepts surrendered pets and places 
them in new homes, but in Heffron's case the shelter agreed to keep his dogs 
until he could provide for them.</content>
