It's tough to get close to patas monkeys. Wily and skittish, they bolt at the 
sight of humans. The leggy monkeys, clocked at 34 miles an hour (55 
kilometers an hour), easily eluded primatologist Lynne Isbell when she arrived in Kenya 
in 1992. "I thought I could keep up on a horse or a bicycle, but trees got in 
the way," she says. After six months of patient tracking on foot, Isbell was 
finally able to sit within yards of one patas group that lived on the Laikipia 
Plateau. And so began a ten-year mission?the longest continuous field study 
of little-known Erythrocebus patas. 

As if on a high-speed biological clock, patas monkeys live fast, reproducing 
at the earliest age of any Old World monkey. Female patas reach sexual 
maturity at age two-and-a-half and give birth at three. Babies can survive alone at 
just six months, though they'll nurse for up to a year. Meanwhile, mothers mate 
and give birth again, every year. So a patas could be pregnant, nursing a 
baby, and shepherding a frisky juvenile all at the same time. 

As mothers, patas range from doting to cavalier, says Isbell. They routinely 
hand off very young infants to other females, who babysit while the mother 
forages. But if an uninvited female comes too close to a baby, the mother will 
open her mouth, a silent threat meaning "keep away." </content>
