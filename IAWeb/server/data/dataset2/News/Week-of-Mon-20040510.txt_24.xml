Each quarter, one article in Healthy Animals focuses on a particular element 
of ARS animal research. The current issue looks at the National Agricultural 
Library's Animal Welfare Information Center, which was created in 1986 as a 
result of Congressional amendments to the 1985 Animal Welfare Act. The NAL 
website contains links to the latest government publications concerning farm and lab 
animals, as well as zoo and circus wildlife.
Other research highlighted in this issue includes:
A test to detect brucellosis-causing bacteria in goat milk. 
A capsule containing a temperature sensor and transmitter that, when 
swallowed, measures and sends cow body temperature readings. 
New swine influenza viruses created by researchers studying the viruses' 
components in order to develop new vaccines. 
A commercially available device called the "4-Poster" that helps control 
ticks on deer. 
Patented selection techniques to find "good" bacteria that help protect live 
chickens.
