Mr Macdonald was thrown in the air and trampled on
A Highland farmer has warned that new right to roam legislation will increase 
the danger of serious attacks from cattle. 
Shaun Macdonald, who farms at Conon Brae on the Black Isle in Ross-shire, has 
written to MSPs after he was crushed and had his nose broken after being 
attacked by one of his own cows. 
Mr Macdonald had been tagging a young calf along with a cattle-man when the 
angry mother suddenly turned on him, leaving him black and blue. 
He has called for the Scottish Executive to consider removing landowners' 
liability to prosecution in case the promotion of greater public access to land 
leads to accidents. 
 It needs to be taken on board that at some point we could have a fatality 
and then where will we point the finger?
