NEWARK, N.J. --  A slaughterhouse escapee has grass under his hooves
again, after spending a week in an auto garage.

The young steer, named "Liberty" by his rescuer, is to spend the remainder
of his days at a shelter operated by Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, N.Y.

He was taken from Triangle Towing Service late Thursday night and arrived
at the shelter around 5 a.m. Friday, where he got a warm welcome from the
cows, said Lorri Bauston, executive director of Farm Sanctuary.

"They were giving him kisses and rubbing up against him," Bauston said.

The transport was arranged quickly, after the slaughterhouse owner
attempted to have the animal returned on Thursday, she said.

A day of negotiations ensued, ending in an agreement by which Triangle
owner Judy Borsellino would deduct the price of the calf from money she
was owed by the butcher for repair work.
...
 Bauston described Liberty as a Hereford breed, 8 to 9 months old.

"His only job will be to teach people that cows have feelings, too," she
said. "It's our hope that once people get to know farm animals as living,
feeling creatures, they won't eat them."

In addition to promoting vegetarianism, her nonprofit group encourages the
humane treatment of farm animals, she said.
