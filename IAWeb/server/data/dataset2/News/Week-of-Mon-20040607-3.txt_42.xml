POPLARVILLE - A Poplarville man was arrested on two charges relating to 
operating a "hog-dog" rodeo.

The Pearl River County Grand Jury indicted Frankie Wheat, 44, of 279 Mitchell 
Chapel Rd., with an animal cruelty felony charge and a related count of 
charging money for admission to the illegal events. 
The indictment, a violation of Mississippi Code Section 97-41-15, reads, 
"about the 10th day of April, 2004, (Wheat) did wilfully, maliciously, unlawfully 
and feloniously and out of the spirit of wanton cruelty, maim, wound, and 
injure livestock. . . "

Count two reads, ". . . did wilfully, unlawfully and knowingly own, manage 
and receive money for the admission of other persons to a place, 279 Mitchell 
Chapel Road, Poplarville, . . . , kept and used by him for the purposes of 
conducting 'hog-dog' rodeos where animals to-wit: hogs, were tormented and 
tortured. . ." 

A felony conviction for the animal cruelty charges could carry between 12 
months and five years in prison, full restitution, and fines of up to $10,000.

The indictment comes just after the People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals (PETA) released a document claiming that Pearl River County law enforcement 
agencies were ignoring the charges.
