Sometimes a cold nose and a warm handful of fur can do a world of good. 

June Augsburg, at left, and Tyler are part of The Monroe Clinic's hospice pet 
program. Augsburg, a dog trainer and pet behaviorist, has trained Tyler well. 
Tyler and Augsburg take a full load of props, toys and costumes for Tyler 
along on their hospice visits -- there's so much equipment to take, Augsburg's 
friend and hospice volunteer partner Pat Landorf of Monroe always goes along to 
help. At 13, Tyler is getting on in years, so Augsburg recently acquired 
Murphy, a 5-month-old golden retriever. Tyler is helping Augsburg train Murphy to 
someday take over visiting hospice patients.
Fans of Tyler know that, for sure. The golden retriever in The Monroe 
Clinic's hospice volunteer pet program is famous for bringing a smile and is a 
popular visitor among patients in the program. 
"I get calls asking if Tyler could come visit. Not June -- but Tyler. Of 
course, he can't drive, so I get to go along," smiles June Augsburg, Tyler's 
trainer and owner. 
Tyler makes a perfect hospice volunteer. He's extremely well-behaved, and he 
follows Augsburg's commands to the letter. This is important for a hospice dog 
-- there can be no jumping or scratching a patient. "He must be obedient," 
Augsburg said. </content>
