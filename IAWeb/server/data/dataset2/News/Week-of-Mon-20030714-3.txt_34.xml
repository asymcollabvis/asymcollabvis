'Shameful'
John W. Kimbrell of Inman [SC] says it is "absolutely shameful" that the
Spartanburg Humane Society is still critically low on operating funds,
still short-staffed, still closed to adoptions on Wednesdays and Sundays
and still receiving up to 10 or more animals a day. "Since the excess are
euthanized, I find it difficult to understand why people abandon pets
there, buy pets from breeders, neglect to get pets fixed and tolerate the
city and county defaulting on their ethical responsibilities," says Mr.
Kimbrell. "If it is true that one can judge the morality of a community
by the way it treats animals, one need only consider the nearly 15,000
companion animals lovingly slaughtered at our shelter last year to see
where we stand morally and ethically."</content>
