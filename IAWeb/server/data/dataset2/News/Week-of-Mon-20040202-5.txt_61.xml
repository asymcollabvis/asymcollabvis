Animal control Officer James Lobdell reached into a cage at the 
county's shelter to pet a mixed lab, whose ribs are showing from malnutrition.
"How are you doing, girl?" Lobdell asked. 
The skinny dog was neglected by her owner, then abandoned.
Ingham County Animal Control Shelter took 956 complaints in January - ranging 
from animal welfare concerns to bites.
That's more than double the 466 complaints it received in January last year. 
"What I've seen a lot this winter is people are exposing their animals to the 
cold weather," said Mari Nicol, the shelter's veterinarian. "Especially with 
outside dogs. People just don't have properly insulated shelter for them."
With just six days registering above freezing last month, it's been a harsher 
winter than usual for dogs and cats.</content>
