Damian Aspinall, all 6ft 3in of him, is sitting awkwardly in his armchair in 
front of a fake fire in the drawing room of his huge Chelsea home. 
It's a magnificent place with a huge central staircase spiralling up towards 
the heavens, but instead of being full of antiques, it's stuffed to the gills 
with paintings of animals - deer, birds, monkeys, giraffes, elephants and, of 
course, gorillas. "Yes, the gorillas!" says Aspinall, referring to the 
primates at Howletts, the zoo in Kent his father, the legendary John Aspinall, set up 
many years ago. 
"When the gorillas haven't seen me for a while," he says, "they race to the 
edge of their pen so I can stroke them. I remember doing it as a child. It was 
so comforting and amazing." He is obviously entranced by animals in the same 
way his father was. He bounces up and down on his chair when he tells me about 
his latest wheeze. "We've taken them back to Africa!" he says. 
He and his friend, designer Patrick Cox, and Aspinall's girlfriend and mother 
of his baby daughter, the TV presenter Donna Air, have just made a 
documentary about releasing seven gorillas back into the wild in Gabon. "Everyone thinks 
we're crazy," he says. "All those animal-world people keep telling us that 
the gorillas won't cope. I disagree. We have bred more animals in Howletts - 
gorillas, elephants and black rhino - than anywhere else in the world. I know 
what I'm doing."
