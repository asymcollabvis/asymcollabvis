Builders for Medallion Homes construct a house in a Bexar County subdivision 
that's designed to blend with the natural habitat. 


Builders spared the greenbelt area next to this home built by Medallion 
Homes. The house was designed to be compatible with the nearby woods. 

"I liked the fact that they had gently placed a house so as not to disturb 
anything in the surrounding area," Green said. 
Finesilver Ranch is not a certified Urban Wildlife Program conservation 
development, Green said, but it could easily qualify. 
Certified urban wildlife yards either retain or put back native plants, 
mainly small fruit-bearing trees and shrubs such as persimmons and agaritas. Three 
criteria ? shelter, food and water ? make the yard a certifiable habitat. 
"It was intended for homeowners," Green said. "But then other entities sought 
to get involved ? businesses, school districts, and in this case a builder."</content>
