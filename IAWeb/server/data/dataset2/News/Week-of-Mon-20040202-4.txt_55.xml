A Bronx tot was mauled yesterday when her pet pit bull snapped and tore into 
her cheeks, police and witnesses said. 
Makailah Barnett, 3, nearly had the side of her face ripped off after a pooch 
named Pepper attacked her and her sister as they played in the house with the 
family's two other dogs. 
"The dog just lost her mind," said the girl's uncle Corey Bellamy, who ran 
across the street when he heard screams. "The dog wigged out." 
Little Makailah was in serious condition last night at Montefiore Medical 
Center, where she was undergoing facial reconstructive surgery. Her 4-year-old 
sister, Isianay, was treated at the hospital for bites to the head and released. 
Emergency Service Unit cops had to fire tranquilizer darts at the pack of 
dogs, which also included a pit bull named Lucky and a German shepherd puppy 
named Bear. They were all taken to the city's animal control center. 
"They're not vicious dogs," Bellamy insisted. "They're friendly." 
Police said Pepper was anything but friendly when she attacked the girls in 
the family's W. 184th St. home just after 2 p.m.
