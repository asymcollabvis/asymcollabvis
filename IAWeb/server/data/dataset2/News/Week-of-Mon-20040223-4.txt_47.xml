The Frankenmuth livestock veterinarian is participating in the newly formed 
Michigan Emergency Veterinary Network -- a group whose aim is to reduce the 
threat of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases in animals. 
"They've been talking about this since 9/11. It's not associated with the mad 
cow outbreak," Luhring said. "It's part of the large picture of being more 
alert and aware of an exotic disease. It's an educational process." 
Eventually, network leaders want to enlist all 3,600 animal doctors statewide 
in the effort, also called Vet Net. 
But other Saginaw County veterinarians who handle mostly cats and dogs wonder 
whether a bioterrorist threat is relevant to their practice. 
"What are (terrorists) going to do? Strap a bomb on a Saint Bernard and set 
him on the road?" asked Dr. Elizabeth S. Walton, owner of Freeland Animal 
Clinic. 
Vet Net will make information about bioterrorism, emerging infectious 
diseases and foreign animal diseases available to veterinarians four times a year. A 
second phase this spring will create a corps of 50 to 100 veterinarians with 
more specialized training. 
The third phase will include training about foreign animal diseases, emerging 
infectious diseases, bioterrorism agents and emergency response. 
"What are the bioterrorism threats directed against animals?" said Dr. Dan 
Grooms, a veterinarian and professor at Michigan State University. "What are the 
foreign animal diseases that, frankly, we are not familiar with? What are the 
emerging infectious diseases?" 
Bioterrorists could cause famine and widespread economic disruption by 
targeting farm animals. They also could spread zoonotic diseases -- those 
transmitted from animals to people, such as West Nile virus. </content>
