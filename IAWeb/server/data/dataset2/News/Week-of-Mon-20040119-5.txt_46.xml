"Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth / My texture is the best fur, of 
chinchilla."
-- Beyonce with Jay-Z in Crazy in Love
MONTREAL - It was pretty difficult to be anti-fur in recent weeks as the wind 
chill hit a mind- and body-numbing -40 C in much of the country. And that 
seems to be the way the wind is blowing.
Fur sales in Canada and the United States have been climbing since the early 
'90s, with major spurts starting around 1999.
Younger Canadian men and women are the ones most interested in buying fur, 
according to the Fur Council of Canada. The trend is true in the U.S., too, 
where the Fur Information Council of America reports that more than half the fur 
sold is bought by women under the age of 44, and 20 per cent by women under 34.</content>
