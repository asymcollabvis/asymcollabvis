  <content>According to a recent survey, 
veterinarians believe fleas will be the number one health risk for pets this 
spring and summer. This issue is most important for cats, identified by 
respondents as the pet least protected from these parasites by their owners. 
Merial, maker of FRONTLINE? and HEARTGARD? (ivermectin) brand products, 
surveyed more than 300 veterinarians and vet clinic staff at the 2004 North 
American Veterinary Conference between January 17-21 in Orlando, Fla. The survey 
determined which parasites veterinarians believe will pose the greatest health 
risks to pets as warmer weather arrives. 
Fifty percent of those surveyed named fleas atop the list of parasites that 
constitute the most significant medical issues in their practice. Vets and 
their staff voiced particular concern about cats and fleas, with 70 percent of 
respondents saying cat owners don't pay enough attention to protecting their pets 
from the parasite. 
According to Dr. Zack Mills, Executive Director, Veterinary Services of 
Merial, "A vast majority of cat owners do not understand the importance of flea 
control in cats and that the use of preventives, such as FRONTLINE?, are 
effective in treating and controlling fleas. Even indoor cats, especially those who 
live with a dog in the household, should be protected from fleas that may cause 
painful diseases such as flea allergy dermatitis. Pet owners need to take 
precautions in order to prevent flea infestation both on their pets and in their 
homes." </content>
