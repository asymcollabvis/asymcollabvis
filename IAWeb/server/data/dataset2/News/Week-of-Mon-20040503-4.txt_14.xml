Judy Borsellino, owner of Triangle Towing Service on Ferry Street in
Newark, says it was "divine providence" when she looked up at about noon
yesterday and saw a brown and white steer from the slaughterhouse across
the street making a break for it.

And he was headed straight into her garage. 

"I saw him coming and I said: "I'm being sent a message," said Borsellino.
"He looked, made a right and came in. I said: 'Close the gate.'"

Not only is Borsellino a "semi- vegetarian" who doesn't eat beef, she
claims the company that owns the steer, Baraka Halal Fresh Meats on
Lockwood Street, owes her $4,000 from work she did on its trucks last year.

When employees of the slaughterhouse came after the steer, she told them
they could have the animal back when she got paid for her work. But after
some thought, Borsellino, who lives in Berkeley Heights, said she plans to
set the daring steer free -- someplace where he won't face a butcher's blade.

"You don't want to hear those animals crying. And the smell. It's a tough
neighbor to have," said Borsellino, holding a ledger she said showed the
slaughterhouse's balance. "This is Amnesty International."
