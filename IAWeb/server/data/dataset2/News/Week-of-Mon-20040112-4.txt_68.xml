  <content>Lacie Hulbert (left) and Carlee Marble, both freshmen at La Conner High 
School, contemplate school lunch without beef. La Conner schools have put 
their beef products on hold until they can double-check that none of the 
meat is connected with a mad cow case in Central Washington. On the menu 
Tuesday was grilled cheese and tomato soup.
There's no cow in school chow

La Conner High School students have a major beef about the lack of beef on 
their school menu for the last week and a half.

But while students may be getting mad, school administrators want to be 
extra sure no one is getting mad cow disease.

"I want my nachos to be macho again," said Josh Van Hine, a 17-year-old 
senior.

Sitting across from Van Hine in the La Conner cafeteria, Cameron Vest, 16, 
said he thought the lack of beef was having an adverse affect on his health.

"We need our beef," Vest said, as he took a less-than-satisfying bite into a 
grilled cheese sandwich. "I think I'm having beef withdrawal."

La Conner Superintendent Tim Bruce, after hearing concerns from some 
parents, made the decision to put a hold on district beef when students 
returned from the Christmas holidays.
That first day after break, beef burritos were on the menu. Bruce said he 
wanted to be "extra cautious" in light of the mad cow scare that erupted 
over the holidays when the first U.S. case of the bovine brain disease was 
discovered in a Washington-raised cow.

"We're going to wait two or three weeks to make sure we've got all of our 
information and that all the meat we have in the freezer is in good 
standing," Bruce said. "We just wanted to be extra cautious."

Local cattle ranchers say the school district's reaction is unwarranted.</content>
