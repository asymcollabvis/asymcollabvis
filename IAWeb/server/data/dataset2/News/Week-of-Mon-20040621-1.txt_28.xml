Two weeks after a mysterious substance killed three of his dairy cows
and sickened seven others, John Koopman has a growing lagoon on the back
acres of his Enumclaw farm, filled not with crisp blue water but with
thousands of gallons of raw milk.
...
Patrick Adams, the special agent in charge of the Seattle office of the
FBI, said evidence gathered so far does not indicate any obvious tie to
domestic or international terrorism.
...
In early May, before the compromise was reached, vandals opened the
valves on two tankers that were hauling raw milk for WestFarm. Almost
120,000 pounds of milk were lost. The vandals also punctured the tires
on the tanker trucks.
...
He is more inclined to believe it was the work of a group like the Earth
Liberation Front, or ELF, an extremist group that targets what it sees
as environmental destruction. The federal government sent out a
nationwide alert earlier this month to warn farmers and other groups
that ELF may be planning attacks.

A few miles from Koopman's farm, three signs advertising land for sale
were vandalized recently. The vandals spray-painted over the real-estate
agent's name and phone number, and on one sign included the tag "ELF."
