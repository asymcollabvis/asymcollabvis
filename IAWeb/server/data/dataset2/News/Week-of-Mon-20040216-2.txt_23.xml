I'll just go ahead and say it: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is 
a ridiculous organization. See for yourself at www.peta.org. 

Before I offend you with my callous disregard for the suffering of non-human 
beings, let me insert a quick disclaimer: It is possible that PETA has 
achieved some degree of good in this world, and the organization should be lauded for 
its efforts to ameliorate the plight of animals used for inhumane research or 
other cruel purposes. It is also possible that I fully intend to gloss over 
these improbable saving graces and opt instead to deride PETA for what I see as 
a darkly ironic ethical travesty. 
That said, PETA recently released an "action alert" entitled "Stop Habitat 
for Humanity's War on Wildlife!" The alert reported Habitat for Humanity in 
Greeley, Colo., poisoned approximately 175 prairie dogs on undeveloped property 
purchased by the group to make way for housing. Using poison to dispose of the 
rodents, said PETA, "is extremely cruel ? when baits like zinc phosphide come 
into contact with dilute stomach acids, phosphine is released, causing nausea, 
vomiting, coma and, finally, death from suffocation when the lungs fill with 
fluid." 
PETA then launched an assault on the local Habitat for Humanity organization, 
and Greeley Habitat's director Tom Chagolla agreed to halt the program and 
relocate 100 of the vermin - er, prairie dogs.
