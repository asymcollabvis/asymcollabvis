Fur is used to trim suits, skirts, outerwear and evening dresses. And a 
pelting of vintage-look three-quarter-length coats is in store.
 
Sometimes fur even replaces fabric altogether, as in Bradley Bayou's 
off-the-shoulder minidress made of strips of silver fox, which was among the looks in 
his made-to-order Halston collection.
 
Despite a gruesome Tuesday morning protest staged by the People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals organization in front of the Bryant Park tents, the 
flurry of fur has been positively blizzardlike.
 
Designers must have been affected by New York's cold winter, so anxious are 
they to clad their customers in mink, sable or fox.
 
Perhaps the most imaginative uses of fur were seen in Mark Badgley and James 
Mischka's collection. Jewel-like beading was applied to the surface of a 
sumptuous mink coat and attached to the seams of a shearling jacket.</content>
