Don't let her age or her height fool you. 
Twelve-year-old Sarah Parker is an ambassador. 
Her mission is to get everyone in Albuquerque to spay and neuter their pets. 
"Everything starts with spay and neuter," Sarah said after a news conference 
Jan. 31 at Albuquerque's East Side animal shelter, where Mayor Martin Chavez 
proclaimed February as Have a Heart for Animals Month. "There are just way too 
many animals out there." 
As Chavez spoke, Sarah, along with several other children from the Animal 
Humane Association's Junior Humane Program, served as his backdrop, holding 
bright pink banners that preached the importance of pet sterilization. 
"We don't ever ever want to euthanize another adoptable pet," Chavez said as 
he cradled an 8-week-old white puppy up for adoption at the shelter. 
About 400 unwanted animals are euthanized in the city's shelters every week, 
a result, the mayor said, of the city's "outrageously high" pet overpopulation.
The monthlong campaign, Chavez said, includes open houses at the city's East 
Side and West Side shelters, where people can learn about animal behavior, 
training, and spay and neuter programs for low-income families. 
Also, the mayor and members of his administration, along with veterinarians 
from around the city, will visit Albuquerque schools throughout the month and 
talk to students about responsible pet care.</content>
