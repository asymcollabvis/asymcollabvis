Richard Kahn: Thank you Anthony for meeting with me today, and
congratulations on the release of your new controversial book examining
the history and future of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF)! Before we
go any further, I think everyone will want to know, are you yourself or
have you ever been a member of the ALF?

Anthony J. Nocella, II: The answer is no. I have never been and I never
plan to be a member of the ALF. I get asked this question all the time.
Oddly enough, in my work I study many extremist, revolutionary, and even
terrorists groups, and yet I never get fingered as being a member of
those organizations. Yet, because I have practiced as an animal rights
activist in the past, people tend to assume that I must be an ALF
spokesperson or cell member also. Of course, this is just a silly
mistake -- the animal advocacy movement should not be directly equated
with the animal rights movement, nor should the animal rights movement
be perceived as being the same as the Animal Liberation Front. There are
many differences, sometimes big differences...I'm simply interested in
analyzing those differences and in helping the public to achieve greater
clarity about militant politics such as practiced by the ALF. That does
not require my affiliation. Further, while we're on the record, let me
state that I have never conducted interviews with the so-called
"underground" either. The only people that I ever communicated with
during the entire process of putting Terrorists or Freedom Fighters?
together were above ground activists, as well as a few former ALF
members that have been convicted and are no longer active in the
underground.
