  <content>=Allegations involving animal abuse at the Riverside County-run Indio 
Animal Shelter has prompted county officials to conduct an investigation. 

Janis McLaughlin,director of the Department of Animal Services with Riverside 
County, was directed by the county supervisor?s office on Wednesday to look 
into allegations that include the beating of animals by staff.

"It will require some digging and checking around to find out what happened," 
said McLaughlin. 

She and other county officials met with Indian Wells resident Mickey 
Deckerand another concerned person in Supervisor Roy Wilson?soffice on Wednesday to 
discuss the complaints. 

The issues discussed also were included in a complaint Decker mailed Friday 
to the Riverside County Grand Jury. 

Decker alleges that the shelter?s staff abused animals while they were being 
euthanized.

"We have a girl who witnessed with her own eyes. They (animals) were beaten 
senseless while ? laying there dying," said Decker. 

She said the witness also claims to have seen newborn kittens die of exposure 
and starvation.

Decker said she has photographs documenting alleged abuses.

Denys Arcuri,legislative assistant to Wilson, said he was concerned to hear 
of the beating allegation especially because he can?t fathom that happening. 

He?s visited the shelter and said the employees do not seem like the kind of 
people who would do that. </content>
