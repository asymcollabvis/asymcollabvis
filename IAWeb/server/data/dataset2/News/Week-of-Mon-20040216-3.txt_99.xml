Bridgeport Cat Project volunteer Gilda Caserta sets up a trap designed to 
catch feral cats huymanely so they can receive medical treatment.


"Ferus," the Latin word for "wild, uncivilized, fierce," is the root of the 
English word "feral."

Volunteers from the Bridgeport Cat Project (BCP) are dedicated to alleviating 
the suffering these cats must endure because owners have abandoned them or 
because they were born in the wild to feral mothers.

"I hate cruelty and neglect of every kind," said Wendy Brown, BCP president, 
a former Bridgeport resident who now lives in Milford. "We humans are 
responsible for all the living things on earth."

Brown and more than 20 other volunteers, mostly women, have raised enough 
money to spay or neuter about 5,000 cats through the BCP since 1994.

The group was founded with a $5,000 grant it used to purchase humane traps, 
carriers and nets, and to pay to have wild cats fixed and inoculated. The BCP 
is part of the national Alley Cat Allies organization and aims to lower the 
city's feral cat population.

The estimated millions of unwanted and homeless cats born in the United 
States every year only live an average of 2 to 3 years. Most are born in the spring 
or fall.

Their shortened lifespan - much shorter than that of domesticated cats - is 
due to early death caused by disease, automobiles, dogs, wild animals and human 
abuse.
