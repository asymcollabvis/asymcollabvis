For game wardens in Texas, the fight against animal exploitation and poaching 
stretches from rural areas well into cities such as Dallas and Fort Worth.
Fewer than 500 wardens are charged with protecting animals on 262,017 square 
miles of land and more than 3 million surface acres of water. For these cases, 
Operation Game Thief is the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's answer to 
Crime Stoppers.
The program, which offers rewards of up to $1,000 for information leading to 
arrests and convictions, protects wildlife -- even in the Metroplex -- said 
Maj. Butch Shoop, who is in charge of the department's Fort Worth office.
"We get lots of calls regarding threatened animals, unprotected birds and 
even off-the-wall stuff like alligators," Shoop said.
The program, created in 1981, has paid more than $140,000 in rewards, 
officials said.
The anonymous reports go directly to a 24-hour dispatcher, and the 
information is relayed to a game warden, said L.D. "Buddy" Turner, director of Operation 
Game Thief.
Dispatchers receive about 1,800 calls a year, department statistics show.
Authorities have filed more than 8,000 criminal cases through the program, 
officials said. More than $1 million in fines have been levied.</content>
