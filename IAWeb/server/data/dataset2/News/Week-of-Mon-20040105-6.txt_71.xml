But the light also makes red zebra GloFish -- A fluorescent glow gives the 
3-inch fish its claim to fame.

like the ones swimming in a local pet store's aquarium -- vulnerable to 
predators. That vulnerability, along with concerns about possible unforeseen 
effects on the environment, has placed the fish at the center of a nationwide ethics 
debate.

The fish, which has been genetically altered so it can absorb and re-emit 
light, have prompted some states to examine the future of genetically altered 
animals.

"I don't want to use the term wake-up call, but it has focused some state 
agencies' (attention) on the fact that this is possible," said Bill Foreman, a 
fisheries resource technician at the Inland Fisheries Division of the state 
Department of Environmental Protection. "We will be re-examining this issue and 
discussing it both within the agency and other state agencies."

GloFish are tropical freshwater fish that would not survive in New England's 
climate, so there is not much concern about them being released and affecting 
the local ecosystem, Foreman said. But because GloFish were bred from fish 
into which a fluorescent gene had been inserted, they raise questions about 
whether pets should be genetically altered, he said.</content>
