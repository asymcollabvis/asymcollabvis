AUSTRALIAN Democrats MP Sandra Kanck has received abusive e-mails from around 
the world after calling for a cull of 20,000 koalas on South Australia's 
Kangaroo Island.

Ms Kanck said she had received dozens of the angry and abusive comments, 
including many from the United States, after her recent calls were reported on 
CNN. 
"Americans are easily the most vitriolic in their attacks, calling me, among 
other things a murderer, an assassin, a barbaric bitch and a sick and horrific 
person," she said. 
"But this type of abuse is water off a duck's back to me." 
Ms Kanck said most of the responses had a common theme: ignorance. 

  



"Some demand that a program of translocation of koalas be implemented, 
oblivious to the fact that such a program has been in operation since 1996 while the 
number of koalas has exploded from some 5000 to 30,000," she said. 
"Some accuse me of pandering to Australia's gun lobby. 
"Many use the absurd argument of comparing starving koalas to starving 
people, suggesting I must therefore support murder. 
"None seem to be aware that koalas are an introduced species to Kangaroo 
Island." 
Last month Ms Kanck said an urgent cull was necessary to avoid an 
environmental catastrophe.
