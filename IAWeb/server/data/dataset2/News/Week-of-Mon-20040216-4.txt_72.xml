America has an epidemic of obesity. Right now, it's all the rage to fight
the battle of the bulge with a low carbohydrate food plan that cuts pasta,
grains, bread and more. And there's no low-carb diet more popular or
controversial then the one pioneered by Dr. Robert Atkins. Now, there's a
new controversy about the doctor's health before his death. Was he done in
by his own diet? Dateline got extraordinary access to Dr. Atkins and his
family just weeks before he died.
...
Dr. Neal Bernard: ?The Atkins Web site says that his good health and his
clean coronary arteries were apparently due to his diet.  An extraordinary
claim.  And apparently one that was not at all true.?

Dr. Neal Barnard is head of the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine, the vegetarian activist group which distributed the confidential
coroner's document.

Dr. Bernard: ?This is not a joke. This is serious business. This is a
major public health problem.?

And it would be a major health problem for millions of people who swear by
the Atkins regime if the doctor's alleged health problems were true and
could be linked to his diet. But Veronica Atkins says her husband was in
good health when he died and she has no problems with the Atkins regime.
She compares dr. Barnard's group to another regime.

Veronica Atkins: ?These things are lies. They're like the Taliban. They're
the vegetarian Taliban. Oh, I mean, I shouldn't insult vegetarians. But
they're like the Taliban, these people. They're nasty.?</content>
