A 2003 Minnesota Livestock Industry Benchmark report argued that the state's 
$5.2 billion animal agriculture industry is an economic engine that is "at 
risk of moving" and called local governments a "key constraint" to growth.
But what is a local government to do if, as in the Ripley Township case, 
three-quarters of the 109 residents signed a petition opposing the project but for 
the most part didn't bother to attend a township meeting on the proposal?
Despite the opposition, the Ripley Township board unanimously approved the 
$12 million project. Board Chairman Bruce Schmoll said a lot of the critics 
either hadn't seen all the facts or made assumptions that weren't true.
"You have a non-ag sector setting policy for the ag people, livestock in 
particular," Schmoll said. "In most cases, I don't think they completely 
understand what's involved in trying to make a living in agriculture anymore."
One rumor suggested the project's manure stench would be so great that people 
would stop going to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, about 30 miles away.
"Hell, if I didn't know a lot about agriculture and listened to (opponents) I 
think I'd be scared too," said Rowekamp, whose plans call for a methane 
digester to zap up to 95 percent of the odor. He awaits county approval of the 
project.
Opponents, however, view the township board's approval as just another 
example of "factory farms" trumping citizens' rights. Residents point to Rowekamp's 
primary investor, New York businessman Ben Zaitz, as evidence of his corporate 
ties.
"If agriculture has to succeed by forcing things upon citizens who don't want 
them, I think that's a sad, sad state of affairs," said Adam Warthesen, a 
policy organizer with the Land Stewardship Project, a nonprofit organization that 
promotes sustainable agriculture and opposed Rowekamp's proposal.
