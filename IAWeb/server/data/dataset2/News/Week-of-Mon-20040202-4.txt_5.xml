  <content>For nine years, Mark McCarthy and his team of volunteers took 
care of Natasha, a rare snow leopard with respiratory problems.
But two weeks ago, the roughly $3,500 annual cost to treat the cat's illness 
proved too high for the nonprofit McCarthy's Wildlife Sanctuary in The 
Acreage. 
"This medication wasn't working," said McCarthy, the director. "If I had the 
money, I probably wouldn't have put her down. I could've tried to get some 
type of other medication. She's extremely rare, very beautiful and it's very sad 
it had to come to that." 
Faced with increasing costs for expenses such as insurance and food, McCarthy 
is worried his budget will force him to lose more of the native and exotic 
big cats, birds and reptiles he supports and rehabilitates.
For 14 years, the work was largely paid for with fees from doing educational 
programs at schools, clubs and birthday parties. McCarthy has received some 
help from foundations, but he faces stiff competition for grants from larger 
sanctuaries backed by big companies, like the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary in 
Jupiter, founded by Peter Busch of the Anheuser-Busch family.</content>
