ONE of the hottest cooking trends requires no heat and no cooking.

Sound crazy? Not to the hoards of foodies, environmentalists, creative
vegetarians and chefs jumping on the raw food bandwagon.

Supporters say raw cuisine offers a new adventure in dining, with an
exciting array of tastes and textures. Best of all, they say, a raw food
diet is also the key to better health.

Eating raw is supposed to aid in the absorption of nutrients and
antioxidants because the vital enzymes in foods are not destroyed by the
cooking process. As a result, followers say they have improved energy,
mental clarity and a drastic reduction in the amount of sleep and food
their bodies need to function.

Eating in the raw has inspired such a following that more and more
cookbooks and restaurants are jumping on the trend.

Oxygen Bar in San Francisco has recently added raw food selections to its
menu, as has Caf Muse in Berkeley. Since 1997, when Juliano Brotman (who
goes by "Juliano") opened his now-defunct raw food restaurant in San
Francisco, raw food restaurants have popped up in New York, Arizona and
elsewhere in California.
