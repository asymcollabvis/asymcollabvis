ST. PAULS, N.C. -- The 34 pit bulls seized from a Robeson County man
accused of animal cruelty won't be euthanized unless a judge orders it,
authorities said Friday.

Katherine Floyd, the county's animal cruelty investigator, said she
would like to personally handle the adoption of the dogs, which are
being held at the Robeson County shelter in St. Pauls.

Nothing will happen with the dogs, however, until the case is handled in
district court, Floyd said.

Paul Laurent, 36, was charged Thursday with 34 counts of misdemeanor
animal cruelty after authorities raided his Rowland home on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
