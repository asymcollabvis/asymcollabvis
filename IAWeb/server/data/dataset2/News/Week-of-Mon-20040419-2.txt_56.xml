  <content>An anti-animal experimentation organization has placed the 
University of Connecticut in the top three of its worst federal law violators for 
treatment of laboratory animals.
The group ? Stop Animal Exploitation Now ? compiled a report that showed 
UConn?s Storrs campus had 43 violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act from 
May 2001 to January 2003.
That places UConn behind only the University of California at San Francisco 
and the University of Florida, with 51 and 47 violations respectively.
UConn?s Farmington laboratory also made the list, ranking number 10 on the 
list with 25 violations. The third Connecticut laboratory cited on the list was 
Yale University with 19 violations.
Michael Budkie, executive director of the Ohio-based nonprofit group, said 25 
research universities were included in the report, which found two problems 
in U.S. laboratories: poor conditions and poor enforcement by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture.
He highlighted the fact UConn?s 43 violations all occurred after the 
university was fined $129,000 in March 2001.
