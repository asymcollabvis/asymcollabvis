Cars stopped and passers-by stared as about 100 bikers filled Spon Street in 
Coventry city centre on their way to their fourth annual pet-food run.
The bikers, from all over the Midlands, gathered outside the Windmill Pub as 
a van was loaded with pet food, treats, and toys ready to be delivered to The 
Dogs Trust - formerly the National Canine Defence League, Honiley - and the 
RSPCA Centre, Coundon.
Family, friends and even some pets joined the bikers as they thundered out of 
the street at the start of their 35-mile round trip.
Mez Walpole, 37, social secretary of the Three Spires bike club, Coventry, 
which organised the run, said: "A lot of us have dogs and cats from rescue homes 
and doing this is our way of putting something back into the community.
"I've had my dog Tilly for four years now and I got her from the rescue 
centre in Coundon.
"There are two other bike clubs from Coventry here today, the Antelope and 
Griffin as well as people from all the Midlands.
"It's not just a way of us getting involved in the community, but also a 
chance for us all to get together.
"Everyone normally sees bikers as a bit scary, so it's also a chance for us 
to show that we are animal lovers with families and kids as well - we also do a 
Christmas toy run to Walsgrave hospital."
Three Spires club secretary Gary Cooke, 41, added: "It really is good fun. We 
round off the day with a party and really enjoy it."
Dogs Trust manager Sandra Wilson said: "It's absolutely brilliant what they 
do for us and all of things they bring are much appreciated.
"Most people think they are big, hard men, but this shows they really do care 
for the animals. A lot of them got their animals from here so they bring us 
in pictures to let us know how they are getting a long."
