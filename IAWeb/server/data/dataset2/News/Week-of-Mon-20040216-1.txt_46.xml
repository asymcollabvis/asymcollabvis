Q: I am a medical student interested in nutrition research. What is your 
opinion of the Nutritional Academies of Science 2003 report "Nutrient Requirements 
of Dogs and Cats"? There's nothing like it for humans! 
My parents and grandparents on my mother's side are whole-food advocates. 
They taught me early on about the "four white evils." Do those also apply to dogs 
and cats?

A: You asked me to withhold your name because you don't want to get in 
trouble with your professors. Hopefully, there's one who advocates the nutritional 
wisdom of whole foods and balanced nutrition.
