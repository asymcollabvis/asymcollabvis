DARIEN -- Priscilla Feral has had a busy winter. When she wasn't fighting 
with the state of Alaska over wolf hunting, she was brawling with Audubon 
Connecticut over deer hunting on its Greenwich sanctuary.

Deserved or not, many animal rights groups have a reputation for extreme 
views, and those of Friends of Animals, based in Darien, may be the most radical. 
Feral, its president, is not afraid to attack not only hunters but 
environmental-protection agencies and animal cruelty prevention groups that do not go far 
enough.

Her organization is not satisfied with improving conditions on factory farms, 
or advocating for less cruel hunting techniques. Friends of Animals wants to 
abolish these practices.

"If you get to the heart of the problem, that is probably radical," Feral 
said Friday at Friends of Animals headquarters on the Post Road. "People ought to 
just stop eating animals."

Feral was born Priscilla Brockway, but after her divorce in 1974, she took as 
her last name the word that describes a domestic animal gone wild.

"I gave serious consideration to it," she said. "I did it with intent and to 
define myself."

Animals are sentient beings and there is no acceptable reason to harm them, 
according to Friends of Animals.

"We are animals, too," Feral said.

Besides Darien, the group has offices in New York City and Washington, D.C., 
employs about two dozen workers and has an annual budget of $4 million to $5 
million. Feral began volunteering with Friends of Animals in the 1970s and has 
been president since 1986.</content>
