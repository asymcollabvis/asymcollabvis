The evidence is usually obvious. A pile of brown feathers indicates a 
mourning dove. Red feathers means a cardinal. Yellow suggests a goldfinch. 
Whenever I find a bunch of feathers in the yard, I know a sharp-shinned or 
Coopers's hawk has come calling. And if I happen to be nearby when the kill 
occurs, the sky can rain soft, downy feathers immediately after an aerial attack. 
It's no wonder backyard birds spook so easily. 
But given the realities of beak and talon, I understand. A fleeting shadow 
crosses the yard and, in unison, all the birds freeze or flee. If I detect the 
panic, I scan the nearby trees for the hunter. Bird-eating hawks can wreak 
havoc at backyard feeding stations. 
That's what these hawks do -- they eat birds. There's nothing you can do to 
get rid of the hawks, but you can make sure your feeding area is relatively 
safe. Hang feeders within 10 feet of trees or shrubs, which provide escape cover 
for smaller birds. 
Try to appreciate the drama of predator and prey. I tell myself I'm lucky 
when a hawk visits my backyard. It's not often I get a close look at such a 
normally secretive bird. And it's rarer still to witness the matching of predator 
and prey. So I sit back and savor the drama. After all, the hawk doesn't always 
win. In fact, it usually loses. Typically, fewer than half of a hawk's 
strikes are successful. 
I feel fortunate to have observed several successful attacks. Once, a group 
of cub scouts came to my house for a bird banding demonstration. I had trapped 
a few goldfinches in advance and after banding them, I let the boys take turns 
holding and releasing the birds. All but the last flew uneventfully into the 
hedge that surrounded the yard. The last goldfinch flew straight up ... a 
fatal mistake.</content>
