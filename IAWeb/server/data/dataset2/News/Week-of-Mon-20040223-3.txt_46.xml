  <content>It was a Friday morning in early October when Debi Smith 
received the e-mail: A Dalmatian had been abandoned and was running loose on a 
country road in Bland County. 
    Smith, the founder of Dalmatian Rescue of Southwest Virginia, hurried 
over from her Elliston home the next day and was appalled by what she saw. The 
dog was emaciated, she said, and a film of dirt covered his once-white coat. His 
teeth were stained yellow and showed signs of damage, probably because the he 
had been feeding on mud and rocks. 
    The dog lingered at the edge of a road between two farms, as if waiting 
to be picked up where he had been left. 
    "We figured he was tied to a chain his whole life and someone got tired 
of feeding him and just dropped him off," Smith said. 
    Smith named the dog Doc and estimated that he was 5 or 6 years old. He 
weighed a mere 45 pounds when she rescued him, but she nursed him back to health 
until he weighed a robust 60 pounds. 
    Doc became house-trained and learned to interact with humans. "He went 
from a frightened outdoors dog to a couch potato," Smith said. </content>
