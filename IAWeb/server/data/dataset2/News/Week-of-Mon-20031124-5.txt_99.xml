It seems incongruous that land-locked Utah would be home to an island. An 
island surrounded by salt water no less. But, Utah, with its mountains, deserts, 
salt flats and salt lake is truly a land of diversity. 
Antelope Island is one of our treasures, and is located just a few miles from 
downtown. From the mainland, the island appears barren and deserted, but this 
vision belies the abundance of flora and fauna that make the island their 
home. Easily accessible by crossing over on a 7-mile paved causeway, or by boat, 
it boasts white sandy beaches, a sailboat marina, nearly 20 miles of hiking, 
biking and horseback riding trails, wildlife viewing, picnicking, camping, and, 
because of the distance from the city and its lights, stargazing. 
Facts:
 The Great Salt Lake, in historic times, has varied from 4,192 to 4,212 feet 
above sea level. There is no outlet to the sea, so the depth depends on 
precipitation. The largest lake west of the Mississippi River, it is approximately 
30 miles wide and 70 miles long. Its depth averages 13 feet, and maxes out at 
34 feet. The salt content varies depending on the water level, but percentages 
of salt have been as high as 27%, eight times higher than the ocean. This 
gives the water buoyancy and legend goes that swimmers will float without sinking. 
The island encompasses 28,022 acres, with an elevation range from 4200 ft to 
its highest peak at 6596 ft. </content>
