The seizure of allegedly abused dogs from two Northern Kentucky kennels this 
month has hit a lot of people close to home. This week, the lead investigator 
in the case found out he was one of them. 
Grant County Chief Deputy Chuck Dills said Monday his sister discovered her 
two missing Shih Tzus are among the 108 dogs seized from Tonya Moukaddem 
Sunbom's Harrison County property a week ago. 
Grant County Animal Warden Wanda Bedard said the two are among eight dogs 
that will be released to their owners today. 
Before this week, Dills' sister, Karen Beaver, last saw her dogs two years 
ago. Beaver lives about five miles from the kennel Sunbom operated in Pendleton 
County. Dills said that three days after Sunbom stopped by his sister's home 
to ask if Beaver would sell or breed her Shih Tzu, the American Kennel 
Club-registered dog valued at $500 disappeared from the family's yard. Six months 
later, Beaver's second Shih Tzu also vanished. </content>
