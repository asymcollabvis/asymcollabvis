  <content>A dead pit bull, a barely alive pit bull and two pit bull 
puppies were removed Wednesday from a South East Avenue property where a known 
animal abuser resides, according to a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals (SPCA) investigator. 
City police had received an anonymous tip that the dogs were being mistreated 
at the property, with one possibly dead, when they were dispatched to the 
scene Wednesday night. The investigation was later turned over to the SPCA. 

 
The dead pit bull was approximately 8 to 10 months old, according to SPCA 
cruelty investigator Monica Shaud. 
Two pit-bull puppies, approximately 6 months old, and what the SPCA believes 
to be the puppies' mother were removed from the property as well. 
The dogs' owner, Traheem J. Bennett, 20, of South East Avenue, faces two 
charges of failure to provide veterinary care, Shaud said. 
Bennett could be fined from $250 to $1,000 and be ordered to complete 30 days 
of community service for each charge, according to Shaud. 
The complaints will be filed at Bridgeton Municipal Court. 
According to a report by Bridgeton Police Ptl. Ronald Caldwell, the dead "dog 
appeared to have died from either natural causes or starvation." </content>
