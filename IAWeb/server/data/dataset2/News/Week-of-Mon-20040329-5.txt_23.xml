Vienna - Hollywood has portrayed them as muscle-bound and handsome but
Austrian anthropologists have found evidence suggesting that Roman
gladiators were fat vegetarians who bore scant resemblance to Russel Crowe.

The scientists did tests on skeletons of two different types of gladiators
- the myrmillos and retiariae - found at the ancient site of Ephesus, near
Selsuk in Turkey.

"Tests performed on bits of bone taken from the skeletons of some 70
gladiators buried at Ephesus seem to prove that they ate mainly barley,
beans and dried fruit," said Karl Grossschmidt, a forensic doctor who took
part in the study by Austria's institute of archeology.

"This diet, which has been mentioned in the oral history, is rather sad
but it gave the gladiators a lot of strength even if it made them fat,"
said Grossschmidt who is a member of Vienna's institute of histology and
embryology.

The Austrian paleo-anthropologists relied on a method known as elementary
micro-analysis that allows scientists to determine what a human being ate
during his lifetime.
...
A balanced diet of meat and vegetables leaves equal amounts of zinc and
strontium in the cells, while a mainly vegetarian diet would leave high
levels of strontium and little zinc, Grossschmidt said.

"The bone density here was higher than usual, as is the case with modern
athletes," said Fabian Kanz from the department of analytical chemistry at
Vienna University.
...
"It seems that the gladiators tried to put on some weight before their
battles," Kanz said.

"But this does not mean that they did not work hard to lose it again once
they stepped out of the ring," he added with a smile.</content>
