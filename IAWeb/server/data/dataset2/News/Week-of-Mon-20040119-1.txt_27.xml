Vet Emma Milne, star of the hit TV series 'Vets in Practice', has returned to 
Egypt with the Brooke Hospital for Animals to raise the plight of donkeys 
slaving in the brick kilns of Cairo.
Emma was first made aware of the suffering inflicted upon thousands of 
donkeys when she visited the brick kiln sites with the Brooke last year. A 
subsequent article in the People newspaper raised nearly ?20,000 and has enabled the 
Brooke to purchase a new 'mobile team' (vehicle plus vets) to reach even more 
'brick kiln donkeys'.
Donkeys often work 12-hour days in temperatures as high as 50C pulling heavy 
loads of bricks on carts between the brick making machines and the furnaces. 
Most suffer from heat exhaustion, pressure sores, lameness, malnutrition and 
broken bones. The workers themselves are very poor and work under arduous 
conditions and tend to beat the donkeys to make them work as hard as possible. 
Before Brooke's arrival, the animals had a very short lifespan and many would be 
worked to death. </content>
