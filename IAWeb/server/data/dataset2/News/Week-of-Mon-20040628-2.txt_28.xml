VANCOUVER - A suspected eco-terrorist giggled with excitement at
care packages of organic raspberries from supporters as he was led in
handcuffs from a refugee hearing Wednesday.

Michael Scarpitti, who was once on the FBI's most wanted list, is
fighting extradition to the United States, where he is charged with
setting fire to logging and cement trucks in 2001.

"I want to stay in Canada, I want to be Canadian," the gaunt raw foodist
said, laughing as he walked out of the hearing, which he asked to have
held behind closed doors. 
...
Scarpitti was sent back to jail, where he survives by bartering for raw
food with other inmates. He trades the cooked portions of the vegetarian
meals he is served for raw courses, such as apples and salad.

His lawyer, Nagar Azamudeh, said the board is expected to rule in the
next few days on whether Scarpitti should be deported immediately or
allowed to make a refugee claim. 
...
His friends describe him as one of the most peaceful people they know, a
characteristic reflected in his strict vegan diet.
...
Barbarash, a former Animal Liberation Front spokesperson, has also been
charged in the past for political activism.

Police raided his Courtenay, B.C., home in July 2002 and seized two
laptop computers, 50 computer discs and about 100 videotapes.

The RCMP subsequently dropped the case.

His friend Scarpitti was listed by the FBI as one of the most wanted
fugitives in America for 19 months.
