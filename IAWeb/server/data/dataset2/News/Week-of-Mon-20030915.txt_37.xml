Grazing: A property right?
Ranchers believe so, but the federal BLM says it’s just a lease

Rancher Bob Miller is bracing himself for the likely end of open range 
grazing on the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.

"There has been so much adverse publicity and so many people who don’t 
understand the situation that we will not be able to survive this battle, 
physically or economically," he concludes.

"Consequently, if the public wants the cattle off that bad, then they should 
pay us for the property rights we own," he says of grazing permits. "These 
are valid existing property rights."

Rancher Don Rowlett agrees.
"If running cattle out here becomes such an issue that we have to spend half 
our lives trying to defend it, trying to meet the rules and regulations and 
facing the lawsuits that come from it, well, I don’t have that much time 
left to live," he says.

But ranchers have to be able to replace lost grazing lands if they are to 
survive, he says.

"The biggest issue to all of us is the replacement," he says. "It has to be 
at a fair market value."

Uncle Sam doesn’t quite see it that way, says Rich Drehobl, manager of the 
Bureau of Land Management’s Ashland Resource Area.

He says the bureau does not recognize an AUM — animal unit month, the 
equivalent of a cow and a calf feeding for one month —as vested property 
rights."We only recognize it as a lease," he says. "It’s a privilege, not a 
right. From the government’s perspective, they (ranchers) have nothing to 
sell."
