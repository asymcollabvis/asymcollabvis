Local farmers mixed on milk plan


A controversial farmer-initiated program designed to cut milk production 
nationwide and raise the milk price paid to farmers has drawn mixed reviews 
from Clark County dairy owners.

    Some local farmers and milk processors worry the supply reduction, set 
to begin this fall, could also drive milk prices up at the grocery store and 
alienate consumers. Others are skeptical whether the plan, conceived by the 
60,000-member National Milk Producers Federation, will work.

    "It's sorta idiotic, isn't it?" said Ron Andersen, the county's biggest 
dairyman, who runs about 1,200 cows and operates milk-processing and 
plastics plants and a truck line in Battle Ground. "My history has made me 
negative to all this. I don't want anything to do with it. I work on the 
open market on the law of supply and demand."

    Any worry about retail milk prices rising seems to be misplaced. At 
Vancouver stores, milk sells for $2 to $5 a gallon, depending on packaging 
and brand. Store owners often price milk as a "loss leader," selling it for 
little or no profit because it brings customers into the store where they 
buy other products.
