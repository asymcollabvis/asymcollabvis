  <content>Amanda Moeckel remembers standing in the Lunenburg High School 
cafeteria nine years ago campaigning for animal rights. 
Now Moeckel, 24, is among 10 female finalists vying to be "The Sexiest 
Vegetarian Alive." 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has given national 
attention to the Lunenburg native, picking her from hundreds of vegetarian 
contestants. 
"It's kind of tongue-in-cheek humor to get people into vegetarianism. ... To 
get media in this country, sometimes you have to do crazy, insane stuff," 
Moeckel said from her home in San Francisco. "I like to talk about vegetarianism 
as much as I can. It's a more compassionate lifestyle." 
Moeckel admits she doesn't agree with everything PETA has done for publicity, 
but she is grateful for the work they do. 
PETA is a national animal rights group that has drawn national attention 
through a number of controversial protests aimed at people wearing fur. 
The animal group claims vegetarians are "healthier and sexier" than 
meat-eaters. 
Since leaving Lunenburg after high school graduation, Moeckel has started her 
own art business, primarily painting animal portraits and animal advocacy 
materials. 
Her art has appeared in "The Animal's Agenda" and "The Abolitionist." 
Moeckel stopped eating meat in high school after reading "Animal Liberation," 
which contains graphic accounts of animal testing and slaughtering. 
"I've always been an animal lover, but I never really questioned what went on 
in factory farms. When I read the book, I realized how bad the conditions 
were for the animals," she said. "It's so hard to stomach. ... I decided to stop 
supporting animal suffering myself."</content>
