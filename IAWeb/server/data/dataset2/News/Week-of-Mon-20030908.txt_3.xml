Monroe is apparently a popular home for man and beast alike - including 
coyotes. 
The Monroe Animal Control Unit reported 107 coyote sighting between June 2002 
and July 2003 - a 149 percent increase from last year.
"Normally we get a lot of reports in the spring, from March to June. This 
year it has been nonstop," said Animal Control Officer Edward Risko.
Increased reporting spiked at 74 coyote sightings in just the last two 
months. Risko said the increased sightings are part of a natural trend across the 
state. 
Normal methods like trapping and hunting in designated areas are no longer 
working because the adaptable coyote has apparently learned to avoid hunting 
areas, he said.
"Virtually nothing can be done to control the [coyote population], just like 
the deer," he said.
An increase in residential population could also play a role in coyote 
sightings.
The Animal Control Unit has been tracking the animals with every report, but 
Risko said it's difficult to mark a fixed point where the coyotes are because 
they naturally roam, stopping only to den up in late spring.
Due to environmental laws, the unit is not allowed to kill coyotes unless 
they appear to be a threat.
"What we're concerned with is the abnormal, like a sick or injured coyote," 
he said.
Though coyotes are relatively nonthreatening animals, the unit has received 
eight reports of attacks on domestic dogs, with three dogs killed and five 
injured.
For each sighting Risko said he gives residents a packet of information on 
coyotes and ways to keep them off their property.
"People have to realize that coyotes are here," Risko said, "and precautions 
need to be made."
