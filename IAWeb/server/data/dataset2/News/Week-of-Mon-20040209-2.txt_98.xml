Federal trappers in Minnesota killed only 125 wolves in 2003, down 
substantially from the average of about 175 in recent years, apparently because a skin 
malady has cut into the wolf population.
Complaints of wolves attacking livestock and pets have been dropping and have 
been nearly nonexistent in recent months, and it appears the state's wolf 
herd may be declining a bit after years of growth.
The decline in complaints has been dramatic, said Bill Paul, who heads the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture's wildlife service's program in northern 
Minnesota.
Paul believes mange, a skin problem that causes animals to die from exposure, 
may be reducing overall wolf numbers in the Minnesota.
"We aren't getting the calls we usually do. We haven't had any calls of pet 
attacks at all in the past few months," he said. "There are a lot of deer out 
there for them to eat, which helps keeps them away from livestock. But I think 
the big thing is that we've seen a lot of wolves with mange in recent years."</content>
