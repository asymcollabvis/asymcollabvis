So many strays, so little time. And money. And volunteers. And space. 
Moore County is unusually rich in the number of animal lovers? groups and 
organizations devoted to helping unwanted animals. 
Some provide shelters and formal adoptions. Others operate out of their homes 
on a shoestring. And a few consist of cell telephone numbers and groups of 
volunteers who manage to get things done without a shelter. 
The most recent count shows no fewer than six active groups, ranging from the 
oldest and best known, Moore Humane Society, to the latest, Sandhills Animal 
Rescue League Inc. 
A couple of people run small shelters out of their homes ? such as Solutions 
for Animals, just over the county line in Hoke. Others lack shelters but 
actively raise money and help pay for spayings and neuterings, such as Animal 
Advocates in Pinehurst. 
?The public is confused as to which group does what, and they are not getting 
the support they need,? says Linda Hubbard of Southern Pines, volunteer 
coordinator for the Moore County Schools</content>
