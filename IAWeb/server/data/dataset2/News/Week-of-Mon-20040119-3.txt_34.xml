"We will chain you and beat you until the tears come no more. We will destroy 
your will, and we will torture you all the way down to the core of your soul. 
Do not fight us. You will never win. You belong to us, and you will obey us. 
You work for us now."

A dog imprisoned on a chain, unable to lie down, stuck outside in the cold, 
placed in solitary confinement without the love and humane care he needs. What 
did he do wrong? Why is he being punished? The dog did nothing wrong. It is 
just the victim of a person who doesn't know, understand or care about what a 
dog needs. And the dog certainly does not understand why he was jailed, in the 
worst way, for doing absolutely nothing. 

My name is Timber, and once I was placed on a chain, where I stayed for 
months. The woman next door tried repeatedly to get my owner to take me for a walk, 
play with me, or even just give me a name. My name was the black and white 
dog. When the neighbor asked my owner why I was on a chain, he replied, "Since 
he is digging up the grass, I decided to chain him up." She then explained some 
of the reasons dogs dig: loneliness, boredom, not enough exercise, no toys to 
play with, no daily walks, etc., and gave him some literature about what dogs 
need from human companions. </content>
