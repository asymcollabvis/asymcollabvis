One of the best-known names in the ongoing battle over predator control in
Alaska is Priscilla Feral, president of the Connecticut-based Friends of
Animals. Feral, who has visited Alaska 50 times over the past 25 years,
was in Anchorage last week to consult with attorneys on her group's legal
challenge to several new state-sponsored aerial wolf-kill programs, and
with her supporters and contractors.

Q. Do animals have rights?

A. Not under the law, they don't. But animals aren't resources like coal.
They're not plants and trees and gravel. ... We're all animals. We all
experience an interest in our future, an interest in freedom. We can have
enjoyment in our lives, and pain and suffering. Well, wolves experience
the same thing. How do you not dare to respect them, or at least try to
not interfere with their lives? The best of all rights we could extend to
wolves or bears or any other free-living animals is to be left alone.

Q. What do you say to the residents of villages such as Nikolai and
Takotna, where jobs are few and where predator control programs are aimed
at boosting moose stocks for subsistence hunters?

A. I don't know why people don't have jobs. I would move to where the jobs
are. Native Americans used to move around to where the food was. ... Our
campaign is not to end the shooting of moose or caribou. It's not about
that. In my heart, I would like to see an end to that. But frankly, I
don't think that we have to agree on all points. It doesn't make us wrong
about wolf control because we are a vegetarian advocacy organization or
that we oppose hunting across the board.</content>
