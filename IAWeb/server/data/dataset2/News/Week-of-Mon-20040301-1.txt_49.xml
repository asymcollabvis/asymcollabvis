Raising buffalo began as a hobby for Steve Fruechte and has expanded into a 
business and some international trade.

"In 1993, I heard that a fellow had some buffalo for sale, and I had a lot of 
pasture that wasn?t in use," the Caledonia farmer explained. 

"My wife, Linda, and I went to look at them and decided to purchase 10 head. 
What began as a hobby grew and grew, and now I have almost 200 head. Around 50 
of them are cows."

On most days, motorists can see Fruechte?s herd of buffalo in fields along 
Highway #44 about six miles east of Spring Grove.

As members of national and state associations and by meeting other buffalo 
growers, they have learned and continue to keep informed about raising buffalo, 
the largest American animal.

Fruechte markets buffalo meat in the area and has also sold live animals to 
Cuba.

Largest American animal

Great herds of American bison, or "buffalo," once roamed the western plains 
of North America. By the late 1800s the widespread killing of buffalo for their 
hides threatened to wipe out these great beasts.

To prevent the whole species from becoming extinct, the U.S. government 
established game laws and other protective measures that allowed the surviving 
bison to live and multiply.</content>
