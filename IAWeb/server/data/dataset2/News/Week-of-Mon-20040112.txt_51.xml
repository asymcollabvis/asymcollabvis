I really like your column! I'm just a little kitten, but I hope that someday 
I'm as smart as you are, and maybe I can help other kitties and their people, 
too. But I wonder....well, maybe it's just because I'm still a baby, but 
sometimes I get confused about who's who. You talk about your dog and your grammie 
and gramma-kitties and your mama and stuff, and I'd just like to get some idea 
of who's what, if you know what I mean. Were you ever kittens? Are you fixed? 
How did you get so smart? Maybe you can put up some pictures of yourselves so 
we can see who's writing the column. I bet you're really cute! *buries nose 
under tail shyly*
Sincerely,
Sin?ad: Buster, thank you so much for your compliments. We love to hear from 
kittens, and we're quite happy to answer your questions and show you some 
pictures. We'll ask Mama to include some photos when she puts our column up online.
Siouxsie: We were indeed kittens once. Tiny little kittens that fit in the 
palm of our Mama's hand. Mama took lots of pictures of us when we were babies, 
but unfortunately, she only scanned one. Still, it will give you an idea of 
what we looked like when we were babies.
Sin?ad: How did we get so smart? Darling, we asked lots of questions and 
learned about everything we could. Mama always reads books about cats and dogs and 
all kinds of things, so we learn a lot from her. After all, we cats are 
telepathic and can read our person's mind.
