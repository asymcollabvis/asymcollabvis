SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Critics of the Sacramento County Animal Shelter,
which has been under scrutiny for years, say that two studies in the
last four years have produced the same results. And now, they're calling
for a full audit of the facility.

The shelter takes in 22,000 animals each year. Some animal activists say
the animals aren't being taken care of properly.

"We believe the public has a right to know how taxpayer money has been
spent," said animal activist Dia Goode.

At a press conference Thursday, animal activists said that officials
have known for years about problems at the shelter, and that they're
dragging their feet when it comes to making changes.
