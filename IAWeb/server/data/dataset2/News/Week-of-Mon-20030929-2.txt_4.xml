Molecule Found in Meat, Milk and Tumors - Study
A non-human molecule found in red meat and milk makes 
its way into the human system when eaten -- and seems to build up especially 
in tumors, U.S. researchers reported on Monday.



The compound, called sialic acid, is found on the surfaces of animal cells 
but is not found in people, and may be one reason why animal-to-human organ 
and tissue transplants do not work well. Animals have a version called 
Neu5Gc, while humans carry Neu5Ac.


But researchers at the University of California San Diego found it does show 
up in the human body, and showed it can be absorbed from eating red meat and 
milk.


They also showed that the body produces an immune response against the 
molecule.


Dr. Ajit Varki and colleagues, reporting in the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences (news - web sites), say it is too soon to make any 
recommendations based on their findings.</content>
