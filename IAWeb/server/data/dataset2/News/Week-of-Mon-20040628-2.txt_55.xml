July 1 ,2004 -- Recent media reports have once again brought to light
the cruel reality some animals experience at the hands of humans. Cases
like Melissa Dawn Sweeney's, a woman in Houston who was sentenced to 30
days in jail and three days with only bread and water for leaving two
horses without food or shelter outside her home for over four months,
can shock and disturb citizens - including agriculture producers.

Both federal and state laws have been enacted to enforce the humane
treatment of the four-legged and winged creatures that provide food,
transportation, and companionship to humans in this country.

In 2001 Texas lawmakers passed a tougher animal cruelty law but actual
prison time for offenders has not become much of a reality. Texas law
defines animals as "cruelly treated" when they are tortured, seriously
overworked, unreasonably abandoned, unreasonably deprived of necessary
food, care, or shelter, cruelly confined, or caused to fight with
another animal.
...
Currently the biggest animal cruelty issue facing the agriculture
industry is the topic of downed animals and what is the most humane way
to deal with them. The Downed Animal Protection Act is currently in
committee, having passed the U.S. Senate in November 2003 as an
amendment to the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations Act.
Ironically the provision was defeated by the House of Representatives on
Dec. 9, 2003, just days before a downed cow in Washington tested
positive for BSE.
