The dog found alive in a garbage trailer at the Edgeboro 
Landfill in East Brunswick Thursday may have cheated death by surviving an attempt to 
euthanize her, police said yesterday. 

This shepherd mix dog, discovered alive at the Edgeboro Landfill in East 
Brunswick last week, may have survived an attempted euthanization.


"We're looking into that allegation," said Perth Amboy Police Director 
Michael Kohut. 
Kohut said detective Richard Cielesz is due to report his findings today to 
the Office of Professional Standards, the Police Department's Internal Affairs 
Office, about whether the dog escaped the botched attempt at being put down by 
the city's Animal Control Office. 
He said it is accepted practice to expose of euthanized animals in the trash, 
but protocol must be followed, including placing the carcass in a 3-ply 
plastic bag. 
Kohut said the department was "confident" that the dog indeed came from the 
city pound. 
"We're trying to identify the owner of the dog and how we got it (the dog)," 
he said. 
The Middlesex County Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also is 
investigating.</content>
