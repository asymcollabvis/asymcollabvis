Ranchers will suffer lower cattle prices ``for some
time to come'' due to the first U.S. case of mad cow disease despite
America's unwavering appetite for hamburgers, steaks, ribs and roasts, the
head of the largest U.S. farm group said on Sunday.

The U.S. response to mad cow disease was expected to dominate the annual
meeting of the 5.5-million-member American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF)
here. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman will speak to the convention by
satellite on Monday.

Wildeman said the Canadian system, which is run by the cattle industry,
was invaluable in tracking down herdmates of infected cows. Canada
reported its first native case of mad cow on May 20 and was the birthplace
of the U.S. case.

``It's a good thing that dairy cow (in Washington state) was born in
Canada. We'd never have found her,'' an Oregon farmer told Wildeman.

A consortium of federal, state and industry officials were drafting a U.S.
animal ID plan that would take its first step this summer: the issuance of
identification numbers for farms, ranches and feedlots. Assignment of
animal ID numbers would begin in early 2005.

With cattle ID, Wildeman said, ``we saved the slaughter, we think, of
10,000 cattle'' by accurately tracing animals in the mad cow investigations.

By comparison, U.S. officials ordered the slaughter of a herd of 450 bull
calves because they could not be sure which one was the offspring of the
infected cow in Washington state. </content>
