 USPCA inspector Penny Keys examining a cage and a dead fox
INVESTIGATORS have uncovered a macabre badger-baiting ring, driven by 
underground criminals betting thousands of pounds on ritual cage slayings, the 
Belfast Telegraph can today reveal. 
The USPCA now believes the brutal practice has become a weekly event in some 
parts of the province, with badgers and other animals being thrown into cages 
to be ripped apart by dogs while bets are waged. 
The Telegraph yesterday shadowed a joint PSNI/ USPCA swoop on a Co Derry farm 
which was conducted after a tip-off that the horrific practice was taking 
place there. 
While no badgers were found, horrific scenes of a sheep ripped apart, foxes 
shot and mauled and dogs with severe injuries to their muzzles have led the 
USPCA to the conclusion that the outlawed practice was being carried out. 
A number of large traps, believed to be used for catching badgers, were found 
at a rundown outhouse. 
And yards away a dead fox which had been shot in the back was still warm.
The corpse of a second fox was contained within a 6ft mesh "cage" which 
animal welfare officers believe is being used as a killing arena. </content>
