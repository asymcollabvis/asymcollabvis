MANHATTAN - The prairie dog, African hedgehog and the Chinchilla, are among today's top fad pets, said Oregon State University exotic animal veterinarian Dr. Ted Parmentier. "Fad" exotic pets, such as the pot-bellied pig of the mid-1990s, are defined as uncommon pets that suddenly become popular. However, some fad pets can be challenging to care for, and potential owners need to be careful before buying into the animal's popularity. Parmentier said prospective owners should be well informed about the pet's needs.

No one should get a fad pet simply because it is "cool," Parmentier said. They may not realize how difficult or complicated proper care can be.

"They might acquire a tiger cub, not realizing that it may weigh over 400 pounds when fully grown and be expensive to care for, as well as dangerous," Parmentier said. "Others may purchase a small constrictor (such as a young Burmese python), not knowing that some species grow to be 16 to 18 feet -- or more -- in length."

The chinchilla, one of the "fad" pets of the moment, will select a diet far too rich for him. They love pizza crust, cheetos, raisins, apples and the like. However these items given more than occasionally will soon lead to digestive upsets and loose stools. These upsets can be fatal.

Diet-related ailments are common among fad pets because owners don't know the nutrients animals need, Parmentier said. For instance, a common medical problem among sugar gliders is sudden hind-leg paralysis, which is caused by calcium and vitamin deficiencies.
