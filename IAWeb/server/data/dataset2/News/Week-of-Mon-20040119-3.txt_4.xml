 Pet expert Charlotte Reed makes recommendations on how to take great care of 
your pet and get the most out of having a pet.
New York, New York (PRWEB) January 22, 2004 ?As you implement your own 
lifestyle changes for the new year, think about what your pet might vow if it had 
the chance. A constant supply of mice to chase? All-you-can-eat bacon and bones 
buffets? Animals? resolutions may best be left to you, but by considering 
their health and well-being, you?ll ensure you all end up happy by this time next 
year.
    Vet time: Start your pet?s year on the right paw with a comprehensive 
check-up at the vet?s office. A regular examination provides a valuable benchmark 
for your pet?s health and can help prevent a host of ills. Dogs should be 
checked twice a year (especially in the spring to banish fleas and heartworm) 
while cats can get by on just one annual visit. Pets over seven years old need 
more attention and should be seen by a vet two to three times a year.
