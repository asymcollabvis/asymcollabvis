Leading members of the RSPCA are seeking to force the Queen to step down
as patron of the charity because of her support for hunting.

Militant members of the group last week claimed that the monarch was
"irrelevant" to the society, which has become vehemently anti-hunting.
They want to drop the "Royal" part of its name, granted by Queen Victoria
in 1840, and become known as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
...
The election has caused controversy because all six candidates are
members of many of the same animal rights groups, fuelling criticism that
the society's agenda has shifted from "animal welfare" to campaigning for
"animal rights".
...
Critics said that the candidates' manifestos confirm that the society has
been taken over by animal rights activists. One member close to the
ruling council said: "The RSPCA's main role is to care for cats and dogs
and other pets but it now has an agenda dedicated to political campaigns
for bans on hunting, whaling, experiments on animals and other animal
rights issues."

The manifestos show that half the candidates are members of the League
Against Cruel Sports and Compassion in World Farming, five belong to the
British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, and two are members of
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. All want foxhunting banned.
