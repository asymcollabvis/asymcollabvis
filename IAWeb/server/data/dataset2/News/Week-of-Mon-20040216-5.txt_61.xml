What's worse: Injecting a fatal dose of sodium pentobarbital into a healthy 
German shepherd or watching him walk in tiny circles as he comes unhinged in a 
kennel where the din of barking never lets up? 

Kathy Eller, Animal Friends humane education coordinator, takes a break from 
work to give a treat to Pokey, a 2-year-old hound mix who has been at the 
Strip District shelter since June 2003. Longer-term dogs get a visit to the 
offices.

Though it doesn't often come down to that in the work of caring for abandoned 
or unwanted animals, the stark choice of quick death or troubled life is at 
the crux of an argument between the growing "no-kill" movement and traditional 
humane society policies that include euthanasia. 
No-kill proponents, who aim to save all homeless companion animals, say that 
euthanizing creatures that are not critically ill is cruel and unnecessary, 
and that successful programs around the country show their approach can work. 
Opponents say that goal is laudable, but that in practice, many no-kill 
shelters turn away the worst-case animals, which still have to be dealt with by 
someone, and that sometimes no-kill shelters end up warehousing animals in 
circumstances that are worse than death.
