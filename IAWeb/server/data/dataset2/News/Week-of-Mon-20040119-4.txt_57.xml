There's nothing better than coming home in the afternoons for Mary Marshall 
Van Sant.

"I pull in the driveway, and my dogs are so glad to see me they're doing a 
body wag," she said.

Van Sant, who has been a pet owner all of her life, has three dogs and one 
cat on her Colbert County property. If a complaint is issued about barking or 
smell, however, Van Sant could be forced to give one of those animals up to be 
in compliance with an ordinance that prohibits more than three dogs and/or cats 
on the premises.

Sheffield and Tuscumbia already have this ordinance on the books, and Muscle 
Shoals will vote on adopting it at the Feb. 2 council meeting.
Councilman Allen Noles said adopting the ordinance "will put us in line with 
the other municipalities, so animal control can enforce the same (law). It 
will make it easier for them."

Colbert County Animal Control Director Tommy Morson says the ordinance has 
proved helpful in dealing with cases of hoarding, when individuals may have 20 
to 50 animals in their care.

In 2003, animal control received two reported cases of hoarding.</content>
