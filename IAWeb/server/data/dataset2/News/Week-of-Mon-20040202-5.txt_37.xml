There's an old saying to the effect that you can't tell a book by its cover.

But the saying isn't really about books; it's about people. Supposedly a
person's outward appearance doesn't tell you anything about what they're
like within.
...
The cormorant's ways are as ugly as its looks. It's a voracious fish
predator, which was no great problem when cormorant numbers were low. But
for some reason over the last 20 years or so the cormorant population has
exploded, and they have wreaked havoc on fish farms and some say upon
sport fisheries as well.
...
Some fish farmers have even been granted authorization to shoot cormorants
preying on the fish in their ponds.

But with the mechanics finally in place to restore some measure of balance
to the cormorant population, four animal-rights groups have filed suit to
strike down the much-needed measures. The plaintiff organizations are the
Fund for Animals, the Humane Society of the United States, the Defenders
of Wildlife and the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida.

I don't know any animal-rights wackos nor do I have any wish to. I
suspect, though, that they're an exception to the rule that people's
natures often match their looks. If the appearance of the animal-righters
reflected the daffiness of their thought processes, they'd all be
dead-ringers for Howdy-Doody.
