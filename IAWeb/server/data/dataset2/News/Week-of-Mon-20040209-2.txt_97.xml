Oxford University's new facility for housing laboratory animals, currently 
under construction, will be a "legitimate target" for violent protests, 
according to animal rights activists.
A source from the Animal Liberation Front, long associated with the radical 
wing of animal activism, told The OxStu that "new animal facilities proposed at 
Oxford would be seen as a legitimate target for ALF members." When asked what 
form such protests could take, the source pointed to previous action taken 
against animal tests at Huntingdon Life Sciences in Cambridgeshire, and said 
that possible action could "range from smashing windows with rocks to arson 
attacks against entire departments." 
Planned for the University science area on South Parks Road, the new building 
will bring animals from several different sites under one roof. The 
University claims it will provide "state-of the-art housing" for its animals, with the 
University Veterinary Department on hand to offer advice. Vice-Chancellor Sir 
Colin Lucas stated: "Animals are used in research only when it is essential to 
do so because no effective alternatives exist."</content>
