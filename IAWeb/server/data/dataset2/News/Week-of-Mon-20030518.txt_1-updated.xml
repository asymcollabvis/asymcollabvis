MANHATTAN - The prairie dog, African hedgehog and the Chinchilla, are among today's top fad pets, said Oregon State University exotic animal veterinarian Dr. Ted Parmentier. "Fad" exotic pets, such as the pot-bellied pig of the mid-1990s, are defined as uncommon pets that suddenly become popular.

No one should get a fad pet simply because it is "cool," Parmentier said. They may not realize how difficult or complicated proper care can be.

Diet-related ailments are common among fad pets because owners don't know the nutrients animals need, Parmentier said. For instance, a common medical problem among sugar gliders is sudden hind-leg paralysis, which is caused by calcium and vitamin deficiencies.
