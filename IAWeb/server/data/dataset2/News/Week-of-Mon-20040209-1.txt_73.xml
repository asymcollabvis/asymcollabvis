"We don't know what it is, ma'am, so it must be a virus."
Now, we don't just have bacteria, fungi and viruses to fear as 
disease-causing agents - prions now get into the picture. Prions are known to be the cause 
of the cow disease BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), a similar disease in 
sheep and goats called scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy and chronic 
wasting disease of mule deer and elk.
Human diseases caused by prions include CJD (Cruetzfeldt-Jakob), vCJD 
(variant CJD, in which the syndrome is similar but the cause is BSE prion, not CJD 
prion), GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome), kuru, FFI (fatal 
insomnia) and Alper's Syndrome.
What makes a prion a prion? It is a form of protein. Like viruses, prions 
attack cells, and do their damage inside the cell. Unlike viruses, they lack RNA 
and DNA, and therefore cannot change the genetic code of the cell. What they 
can do, though, is just as damaging. They convert normal protein molecules into 
dangerous ones just by inducing the normal molecules to bend their shape. 
Thus, they can cause disease by inheritance as well as by infection.</content>
