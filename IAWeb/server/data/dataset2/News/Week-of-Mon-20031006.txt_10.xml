The Cuyahoga Valley National Park soon will begin a study on white-tailed 
deer that could lead to sharpshooters killing the animals, perhaps in two years.
The National Park Service intends to begin the 18- to 24-month study later 
this year, park Superintendent John Debo said.
The deer problem in the Cuyahoga Valley has not gone away, he said, and 
officials feel the herd must be reduced to protect the park's plants and animals.
``We still have a very high deer population in parts of the valley,'' he 
said. ``... The problem is as real as it was a few years ago.''
The study -- called an environmental impact statement -- will include 
considerable public participation in formulating a deer-management plan for the 
33,000-acre park.
Debo said it's presumptuous to say that sharpshooters will be used because 
the upcoming federal study will consider ``all feasible alternatives'' for 
reducing deer numbers.
In 1997, park officials wanted to use sharpshooters to kill 470 deer. But 
that effort was blocked by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., after 
animal-rights activists sued to stop the killing.
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman said the park service had failed to make a 
convincing case that shooting deer would not have a negative impact.
At least two national animal rights' groups are keeping an eye on what 
happens in the Cuyahoga Valley park.
Heidi Prescott, national director for the New York-based Fund for Animals, 
one of the groups involved in the 1997 suit, intends to ask the fund's lawyers 
to closely review the park service plans.
``We're still interested in opposing hunting in the national park,'' she 
said. ``Hunting is only a Band-Aid approach to controlling the deer population.''
