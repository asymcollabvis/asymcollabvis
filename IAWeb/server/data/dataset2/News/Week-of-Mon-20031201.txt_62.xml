The Priceless Parrot Preserve is the first and only animal sanctuary in New 
York dedicated exclusively to the permanent care of exotic birds. 
Both Ed and Marietta have been involved with exotic birds for many years, Ed 
as a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. They do not breed, sell or adopt out any 
bird that comes into their care, and they say that every bird taken in will 
live the rest of its life with dignity in the preserve. 
Initially the Averys bore the cost of adopting and rescuing the birds 
themselves, but they have now formed a non-profit, 601-C3 organization funded by 
public donations. 
Animal News Center: Tell us about yourself. How did you get interested in 
animal welfare, and in creating this parrot sanctuary? 
EA: My wife, Marietta. We've had birds and pets all our lives. We were 
married a few years and I said "I'd like to have a 'Baretta' bird," and she said, 
"Ok, what kind of bird is that?" I said, "It's a cockatoo." 
So she bought me one for Christmas and that started the whole thing.</content>
