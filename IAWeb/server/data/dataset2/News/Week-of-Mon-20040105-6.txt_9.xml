Last year a ginger cat with one eye was found in a box which had a brick on 
top of it in Cambridge Drive, Ipswich. The cat was claimed by its owner after 
it was dumped by someone else.

Ms Kettle said: "Rudolph could have been put there by kids or neighbours who 
don't like cats. 

"As Rudolph is so easy going it would not have been difficult to put him in a 
box and carry him away.

"People don't stop and think ahead. Five minutes of fun it could have ended a 
cat's life."

Cats are sometimes abandoned over Christmas because owners feel their pet is 
in the way when family visit. Another reason is when owners favour a kitten 
over an adult cat.

People are urged to think long term by taking on the responsibility of a pet. 
They should look at whether they can afford to pay for food and vet bills, 
and whether they have time to devote to it.

Rudolph is pure black with no markings and is thought to be three to four 
years old.</content>
