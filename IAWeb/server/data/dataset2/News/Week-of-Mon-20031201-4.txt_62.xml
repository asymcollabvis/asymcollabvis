  <content>The 880-pound bull buffalo that Bud Koeppen has dubbed Big Bad John raised 
his head and cast a wary look at the men standing on the other side of the 
electrified fence. 
Looking into the eyes of a bison, the largest animal native to North America, 
is likely to inspire thankfulness for fences, electricity and the safety they 
provide, but Big Bad John, who is less than a year old, seemed more 
interested in the movements of Annie, the more inquisitive of Koeppens? two dogs. 
Koeppen and his brother and business partner, Wally, are still adjusting to 
the fact that the Brokenwagon Bison Ranch has moved from the planning and 
construction stage to reality. 
The buffalo have been roaming for just a week on the 150-acre pasture on the 
Wheeler farm once owned by their parents, Clarence and Myrtle Koeppen. 
Their bison herd, acquired at an auction in Lewiston, Minn., includes one 
bull, two calves and seven cows, each of whom is expected to deliver a calf in 
the spring. When they bought their animals, they weren?t sure how many they 
could load into the cattle trailer belonging to their friend, John Williams. As it 
turned out, they would have had room for another cow or two more calves. </content>
