  <content>By now, pretty much everyone in the United States has heard of
the Holstein from Mabton, Wash., found to be infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as ?mad cow disease.? What
people may not know is how this disease that devastated the British beef
industry in the ?90s has been allowed to spread to Washington state.

After all, don?t we have governmental agencies set up to protect our food,
such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)? Yes, we do have these agencies, but anyone who has
wondered what ill-effects the push for ?less government? has gotten us
need look no further. 
...
Presidential contender Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), who, incidentally,
is a vegetarian, has devoted a web page to mad cow disease which states,
?Last year, the USDA tested only 19,990 cattle believed to be at risk for
mad cow disease, out of a population of about 96 million or 1 out of every
5,000 cattle. By contrast, in Europe every single animal above a given age
gets tested for this fatal brain-wasting disease (one out of every four
cattle).?

Kucinich proposes seven new steps to help make meat safer: Prohibit meat
from downer cattle from entering the human food supply; test all downer
cattle (estimates range from 190,000 to 970,000 animals) using modern
rapid quick tests; establish a mandatory trace back system for all
bovines; require mandatory recall of food products infected; prohibit the
feeding of the remains of any mammal to any animals that humans eat;
tighten the law on dietary supplements, which currently allows supplements
to contain central nervous system tissue; and require doctors and
hospitals to report all cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob (mad cow) to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

All of these measures would enhance public health but would also cut into
the meatpacking industry?s fat corporate profits. Hence the resistance. </content>
