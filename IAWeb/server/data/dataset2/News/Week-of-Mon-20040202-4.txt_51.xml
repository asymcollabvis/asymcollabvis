When members of the World Society for the Protection of Animals say they'll 
go halfway around the globe to help animals, they really mean it. 

     Since last year, the worldwide agency, whose U.S. office is in 
Framingham, has been working with GIs serving in Iraq, their families and the military 
to bring home stray dogs befriended by the troops. 

     Stray dogs are a common sight on Iraqi streets, where the animals are 
often used as working animals, like guard dogs, but seem to be rarely kept as 
companions. 

     "There are a lot of stray dogs in Iraq," WSPA's USA Director Laura 
Salter said. "The Iraqi culture is not one in which there's a strong fondness for 
dogs. There seems to be a widespread fear of catching disease from dogs. 

     "What we understand is that the majority simply (wander the) road, 
scavenging, looking for something to eat." 

     For soldiers like Army Staff Sgt. Jason Cowart of Fort Hood, Texas, the 
sight of the starving animals was impossible to ignore. 

     Using military rations, Cowart drew one scrawny puppy from under a 
Dumpster and managed to befriend the animal. Eventually named Ratchet, the dog rode 
next to Cowart in the front seat of a Humvee throughout the war. </content>
