WOODSTOCK, N.Y. - If you're road-tripping this summer, chances are
you'll end up at one of those nondescript highway rest stops that serve
mainly juicy burgers, greasy fries and syrupy soft drinks. But the way
food gurus Nikki and David Goldbeck see it, travel is no excuse for
eating badly.

The couple, who penned several nutrition books including the 1973 best
seller "The Supermarket Handbook," like to avoid the fast food chains
that dot the nation's interstates whenever they drive from their
Woodstock home to the warmth of Florida's Miami Beach every winter.
...
The Goldbecks recently compiled their favorite eateries, along with
other listings discovered through their own research or recommended by
other health-conscious travelers, into a new book aimed at giving
travelers a nutritious alternative.

"Healthy Highways: The Traveler's Guide to Healthy Eating" lists about
2,000 health-oriented restaurants and natural food stores in the 50
states - all easily accessible from the exit ramp of a highway or a
major road. Telephone numbers and hours of operation are also included.
