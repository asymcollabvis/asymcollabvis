The government today launched its plans for a new centre to research
alternatives to animal research.

The science minister, Lord Sainsbury, claimed that the new centre would
help eliminate any unnecessary experiments on animals and the move was
immediately welcomed by the science community.

However, animal rights campaigners immediately condemned the move as a
"fig leaf" to hide the real issue that experimentation involving animals
was harmful and of little benefit.

The centre will work on the principal of the three Rs - replacement,
reduction and refinement. The Office for Science and Technology has
doubled its funding for alternatives to animal research from ?330,000 to
?660,000.
