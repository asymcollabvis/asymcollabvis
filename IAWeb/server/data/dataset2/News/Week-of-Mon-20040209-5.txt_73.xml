2/15/04 Valentine's Day makes February the month of love, and when romance 
seems to be blooming everywhere, cats are no exception.

Soon animal shelters will be flooded with stray kittens, as they are every 
spring. 
This year the Santa Barbara County Animal Services Department will be working 
in conjunction with community organizations to keep many kittens from being 
born and to find a safe home for the hundreds of kittens expected to arrive 
this season, which begins mid-March and will taper off around October.

The plan is to take a proactive approach to the kitten season, said community 
outreach coordinator Sara Wall. All three county shelters will be working 
with Catalyst for Cats of Santa Barbara, Volunteers for Inter-Valley Animals of 
Lompoc, and Animal Shelter Assistance Program of Santa Barbara, among others, 
to encourage the public to spay and neuter their pets.

They will also help each other if one office gets overwhelmed. In addition, 
feral cats that are trapped will be fixed, and foster parents will be recruited 
to nurture and train young kittens so that they will be ready to be adopted.

The shelter has a list of foster parents ready, Wall said, but it needs more. 
In any given day, one or two dozen litters can be brought in. Last year about 
six dozen were brought in at the start of the season. The shelter takes care 
of all stray animals, but cats tend to be abandoned more, Wall said. In 
addition, one cat can have many offspring that reproduce exponentially.</content>
