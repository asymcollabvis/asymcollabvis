WHITEHORSE, Yukon Territory--With governmental jurisdiction questions 
muddying the requirements for exporting and selling animals, the owners of the 
Yukon's only reindeer farm say they may have to kill their animals because they 
can't afford to keep them. 
Stella and Lloyd Gregory, owners of Northern Splendor Reindeer Farm north of 
Whitehorse, say they are not allowed by Yukon Territory laws to sell any of 
the reindeer. 
In an April 20 letter, Edward Huebert, the deputy minister of the Department 
of the Environment, wrote the Gregorys that the transfer of natural resource 
control from Ottawa to the territorial government had affected their ability to 
sell the reindeer. 
He said the reindeer are not considered game farm animals, which is a reason 
they're being held back. 
But two ministers argued recently that the Gregorys can export and sell the 
reindeer if they want to do so.
