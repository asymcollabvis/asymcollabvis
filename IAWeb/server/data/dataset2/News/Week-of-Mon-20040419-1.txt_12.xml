Between the nights of April 9 and April 10, we broke into the Small animal
Laboratory and the Dog Kennel at W.B. Saul High School in Roxborough,
Philadelphia.

We removed a total of 48 animals - 44 small animals (some of which were
indeed being tested upon in lab experiments), and 4 beagle puppies being
raised by students training to be future vivisectors.

In total, we removed: four beagle puppies, two chinchillas, one ferret, 26
gerbils, three hamsters, nine rats, and two mice. All of the animals were
taken to new homes where they will be loved and cared for - not
experimented upon and not the training fodder for would-be vivisectors.

They will also not be put to death when their usefulness as an
"educational tool" is through. While there, we also took photographs of
several cruelties towards livestock animals - including a barn full of
cows chained by their necks to small stalls, where they are not even able
to turn around, and two young veal calves confined by themselves in small
cages.
