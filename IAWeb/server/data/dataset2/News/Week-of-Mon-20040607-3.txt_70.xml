Earth Liberation Front Frustrates Law Enforcement With Increasingly
Destructive Campaign
...
LOS ANGELES -- Fire ripped through luxury homes under construction in
Washington state. Molotov cocktails ignited sports-utility vehicles in
Virginia. Graffiti coated a dozen SUVs in Santa Fe, N.M. All in the name
of Mother Earth -- and all apparently the work of a shadowy
environmental group known as the Earth Liberation Front (ELF).
...
The loosely organized underground movement is continuing to frustrate
law enforcement officials across the country. Only a few arrests have
been made in the past five years, and there have been even fewer
convictions. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in rewards have been
offered by authorities, and additional FBI agents have been assigned to
investigations involving the group.

Unlike traditional criminal enterprises such as the mob or biker gangs
with rigid hierarchies that have been successfully infiltrated by
undercover agents, there is no formal club for officials to break into.

Federal investigators and prosecutors have expressed frustration at the
difficulties of cracking down on multi-state campaigns of low-level
crimes, intimidation and property damage because of a lack of applicable
federal laws.
