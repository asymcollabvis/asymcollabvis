Thanks to cheap flights and a fascination with the environment, ecotourism is 
one of the fastest-growing sectors of the travel industry. But scientists 
have now discovered that it may harm the very species it is meant to help. 
Charles Arthur reports on the dangers behind a growing trend

The silence is nerve-tingling. The lioness is poised to spring on her prey, 
in the dusty African savannah. Then comes the attack: a struggle, a bite, and 
the antelope is downed, and dying.
And that is followed by a new sound: walkie-talkies crackling to life with 
urgent messages, the gunning of Land Rover engines as another score of tourists 
are driven to the site of the kill to gawp at one of the world's 
fastest-dwindling species living out its life. To the bewildered lioness, the clicking of 
camera shutters and the sight of rhinoceros-sized metal beasts is just 
something she has to deal with - even, or especially, when she is eating. And these 
days, many companies will be happy to label such a trip "ecotourism".
"That's the worst kind of ecotourism," said Dr Nigel Dunstone, lecturer in 
zoology at the University of Durham, who has been investigating the effects of 
ecotourism on animal species since 1985. "But the real problem is that it has 
become too big a category. You can even find some white-water rafting holidays 
being called 'ecotourism'. It can cover everything from holidays where 
everything you do is sustainable, including the way you get to the destination and 
what you do there, right through to places that just concrete over a huge area 
for a landing strip and put up a great big concrete hotel."</content>
