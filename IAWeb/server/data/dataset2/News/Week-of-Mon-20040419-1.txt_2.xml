UK supermarket chains Tesco, Asda and Safeway are importing substantial 
amounts of organic food rather than buying from UK farmers, even when UK supplies 
are available, according to a survey by the Soil Association, which certifies 
and promotes organic food.
In the period covered by the survey, less than a quarter of the organic pork 
on sale in Asda was from UK farms; in Tesco only half the pork and under half 
the organic beef was from the UK. Only 13% of Safeway?s cauliflowers were 
homegrown, and in Asda only 19% of onions were homegrown. 
In the UK, farmers producing organic pork must meet high animal welfare 
standards, which is not always the case in other countries, the Soil Association 
warned. All imported organic food must meet European organic legal requirements, 
but for some products such as pork these may be lower than the standards 
required of organic pork reared in the UK.
