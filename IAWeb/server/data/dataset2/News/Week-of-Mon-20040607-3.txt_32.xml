JACKSON, Miss. - When American troops unearthed Al Qaida bioterrorism manuals 
in Afghanistan caves a couple of years ago, U.S. veterinarians were suddenly 
pulled into the war on terrorism.
The documents explored how terrorists could infect American livestock and 
domesticated animals with bubonic plague, anthrax and tuberculosis. They showed 
how viruses could be distilled into powders and added to dirt where animals 
gather: horse shows, livestock auctions, county fairs.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture warned colleges that veterinarians would be the front line in 
detecting terrorist-engineered epidemics. Veterinary students must now learn to spot 
medieval terrors like bubonic plague - whether the symptoms erupt in pigs, 
cattle, horses, poultry, parrots, puppies or kittens.
There are 28 vet colleges in the United States and those that are located in 
Southern states - Alabama, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, Mississippi, 
Arkansas_ all now offer bioterrorism programs, said Dr. Gary Beard, assistant dean 
of continuing studies at Auburn University's College of Veterinary Medicine.
