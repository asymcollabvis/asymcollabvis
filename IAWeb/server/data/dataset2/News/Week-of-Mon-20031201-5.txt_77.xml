Scientists say lab experiments on monkeys, dogs and other animals are
needed to develop and test new medicines. But activists call the tests
cruel and unusual punishment ? and they're taking the animal-rights debate
to the courts and the streets
...
On the video monitor, two small marmosets ? tree-dwelling South American
monkeys with white ear tufts ? cling tightly to each other, looking
terrified. A third writhes in pain, postsurgery, on the floor of its cage;
others have raw and bloody head wounds that seem crudely stitched up. The
animals appear in a 21-minute expos? called Cutting Edge, shot for the
British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) in one of Cambridge
University's neuroscience research labs. The monkeys' brains had been
deliberately damaged in experiments meant to simulate the symptoms of
stroke and Parkinson's disease. Important research that could help save
human lives ? but at an obvious cost in animal suffering.

Though vegetarianism is the biggest issue for animal-rights activists ?
and fur gets a lot of attention because it involves both celebrities and
fashion ? the use of animals in scientific research is acquiring a higher
profile in the ethical battle for the hearts and minds of policymakers and
public alike. Many within the movement apply relentless pressure to
stockholders, suppliers and other business contacts, and some ? a small
substratum ? believe that a proper response to violence against animals is
violence against humans. </content>
