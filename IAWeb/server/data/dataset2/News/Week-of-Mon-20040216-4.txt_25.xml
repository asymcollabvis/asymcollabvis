  <content>If doctors had to identify the deadliest sin affecting
Americans today, they probably would name gluttony as the No. 1 killer.

As obesity in the United States reaches epidemic proportions, with more
than 60 percent of adults overweight or obese, public-policy makers and
health officials are scrambling over ways to improve the American diet.

But Don Colbert, physician and nutritionist, thinks the obesity crisis
could be solved if Americans would pause before inhaling a super-sized
fast food meal and ask themselves a simple question: "Would Jesus eat this?" 
...
And Colbert's not the only Christian diet guru urging people to ask what
Jesus would eat. Christian advocates of vegetarianism say if Jesus were
alive today, he would maintain a plant-based diet out of compassion for
animals.

Others say Jesus would approve of genetically modified food, given his
propensity for transforming and multiplying food.

Although there may be disagreement over what Jesus would choose given the
option of a veggie burger, broiled lamb with garbanzo beans, or
genetically modified corn on the cob, growing numbers of Christians are
looking to the Bible for dietary guidance, hoping Scripture might succeed
where science has failed in inspiring healthy eating habits.

Stephen Kaufman, co-chair of the Christian Vegetarian Association, hopes
more Christians will start making faith-based choices about what they eat. </content>
