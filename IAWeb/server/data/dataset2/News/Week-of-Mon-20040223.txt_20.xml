 With New York in the grips of another frigid winter, the city's top
designers obviously feel the time is right to go for fur in a big way.

At the recent fall 2004 collections, the fur flew. "It's in every single
show, it's everywhere," says Hal Rubenstein, fashion features director of
In Style magazine. "It's used with the same frequency that people use
satin and wool."

"All I see is fur," says Kate Betts, editor of Time's special style and
design magazine. "It's everywhere. It's luxurious and special, and that's
what people will be trading up to next fall."

 In Style's Rubenstein points to a move away from understated luxury.
"We're back to evening glamour with lots of big jewels," he says. "It's
logical that people want other examples that state a certain level of
luxury, and fur is a way to do it."

So true, says Lisa Franzetta, a spokeswoman for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals (PETA). Franzetta, who attended the recent Fashion
Week and was dismayed to see so much fur on the runways. "Sadly," she
says, "some people have reacted to Sept. 11 by getting really
self-absorbed and selfish, and wearing fur is one of the ways we've seen
that arrogance manifested."

Franzetta says she finds it interesting that many designers using fur are
disguising it, shearing the pelts or dying them bright colors. "We're at
the point," she says, "that people need to be reminded that fur comes from
animals."

On the other hand, Franzetta says, PETA is encouraged that there is a
significant amount of faux fur available as well. It shows, she says, that
"you can have a look that reflects the beauty of animals" without causing
them "hideous suffering."</content>
