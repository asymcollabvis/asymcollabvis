Don't let your cat get fat. 
It's the most common nutritional disorder in humans and pets -- obesity. 
For some unkown reason, cats are being hit extremely hard. 
"An average weight cat should be around ten pounds, and we're seeing cats 
that are 18, 21 pounds. I've seen one that was 28 pounds. There's actually one on 
record at 54 pounds," said Dr. Craig Prior. 
Lucky is a fat cat. He used to weigh 19 pounds. Chunky is cute -- until you 
consider what it's doing to your cat. 
"You're predisposing your cat to diabetes. You're predisposing your cat to 
liver problems, you're predisposing your cat to joint problems. It's just not 
healthy," said Dr. Prior. 
In fact, the number of feline diabetes cases has skyrocketed, and for some 
reason, overweight, older male tabbys are most at risk.
Just a few weeks ago, Lucky's owner noticed he was drinking a lot of water. 
That, along with urinating, eating more and sudden weight loss are all signs of 
diabetes.
"We've limited how much food that he's getting, he's down to just one can a 
day. So he gets a half a can twice a day, which he doesn't like at all. And 
then we've also had to start giving him insulin shots," said Lucky's owner.
It's not just how much food they eat, it's the kind of food. Cats are 
predators, so they need meat. High in protein, with low carbohydrates. And the best 
place to find that is in canned food with no gravy.</content>
