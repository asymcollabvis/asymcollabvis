Animal activists in Orissa are furious at the wildlife department's move to 
plant four-inch-long iron spikes on a route frequented by elephants in a bid to 
keep them away. 

The spikes were placed under a bridge located on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar 
to prevent elephants from travelling here from a nearby sanctuary, where 
around 20 elephants reside. 

In the winter, tuskers from the adjacent Chandaka sanctuary join them, 
swelling their numbers to around 40. 

These elephants used to regularly cross from under the bridge and travel to 
farmlands and human habitations here, creating chaos and damaging crops.

The forest department initially dug trenches to prevent the elephants but 
these proved ineffective. Then they put up stonewalls. 

To avoid the barricades, the elephants took to travelling from under the 
bridge, located over a stream.

Locals said the taller elephants would bend on their knees to cross over. 

In a bid to again outwit the elephants, the forest department constructed an 
iron and concrete platform under the bridge and placed the spikes on it.
