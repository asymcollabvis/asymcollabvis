BOSTON -- Carrie Sherlock was outside her Uxbridge home with her
3-year-old son when he asked to be held. As she bent to pick him up, two
neighborhood Rottweilers came from behind her and snatched the boy from
her grasp. Three construction workers heard her screams, beat the dogs
with hammers and saved the boy.

Though courts have repeatedly labeled the dogs vicious and ordered them
destroyed, they are still alive, Sherlock testified Tuesday, because the
owner has continued to make appeals and move the dogs in the three years
since the attack.

That wouldn't be possible under legislation that would force cities and
towns to take custody of dangerous dogs until appeals are exhausted, then
force owners to pay the costs if the dog is ultimately condemned.

"I don't think these types of dogs should have the right to be held in
their owner's hands," said Sherlock, who appeared with her husband and
son, Matthew, before a legislative committee considering more than a dozen
dog-related bills. Matthew, now 6, suffered minor injuries.

Sponsors of the legislation say the state's dog laws are badly in need of
an overhaul.

One bill, sponsored by Rep. Bradford Hill, R-Ipswich, would more clearly
define what is a dangerous dog - not by breed, but by behavior. Hill said
this would give more guidance to local communities in fashioning their own
dog ordinances.
