Like most livestock producers, when I see that a major magazine is doing a
feature story on food or diets, I brace myself.

Anyone old enough to remember the anti-red-meat '80s is still gun shy.

But things have changed. The public's perception that red meat is bad for
you has been ameliorated in large part by two factors: the continuing
steadfast research and promotion funded by the Beef Check Off, and the
more recent acceptance of the Atkins all-meat, all-fat diet.

I mean, nobody praised American farmers, agribusiness, or immigrant labor
for the abundance, variety, safety, wholesomeness and relative low cost of
our food supply. And there were enough politically correct potshots to
balance out those stubborn facts that won't go away. But they concluded
that moderation in portions and balance is the right way to eat.

Wow! What a concept.

The letters to the editor the following week regarding the story contained
typical responses from those whose ox had been gored, including this one:

I was surprised that animal meat and other animal products were included
in your report on healthy eating. The vegan diet is the most healthful one
there is. Your body can thrive on the bounty of fresh fruits, vegetables,
grains, legumes and soy. Going vegan is the best way.

In response to Ms. Frisk's letter to the editor expressing surprise that
meat was included in Time's report on healthy eating, then promoting her
vegan diet as the most healthful, the real surprise is that Time will
print letters like hers. In her defense, there are nice people who still
believe the earth is flat and Communism was a good thing. But humans have
two legs, a brain and are omnivorous.</content>
