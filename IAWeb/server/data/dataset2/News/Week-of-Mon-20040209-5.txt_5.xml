Both Fraley and Wenum work for the state Department of Fish, Wildlife and 
Parks; Fraley handles community outreach for the agency in Kalispell, and Wenum 
handles the lions.

A few years back, after the record winter of 1996-1997, Wenum's phone 
wouldn't stop ringing. Lions seemed to be everywhere.

They were living under cabins, threatening dogs, stalking around horse 
pastures. They were sniffing out the Kibbles left on Kalispell porches, and they 
were, occasionally, pouncing on pets.

It was all a function of the weather.

That record winter had slowed down the deer, and the lions had grown fat on 
easy prey and winter kill.

But come spring, some 80 percent of the deer were gone, gobbled up by lions 
and bears and wolves and, most of all, by a long, hard winter of deep snow and 
cold weather.



With deer, elk populations up, FWP getting calls on mountain lions in 
neighborhoods

KALISPELL - It's been a while since Erik Wenum's phone jangled with stories 
of mountain lions prowling Flathead Valley neighborhoods.

"But we're getting some reports coming in," said John Fraley. "We though it 
would be a good idea to get the word out."
