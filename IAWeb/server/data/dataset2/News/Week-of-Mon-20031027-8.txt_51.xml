  There's trouble on the other side of the chain-link
fences surrounding the state government's Foothills Wildlife Research
Facility. The dusty pastures are ground zero for a deer-killing plague
that is frighteningly similar to mad-cow disease.

It was here that the condition, known as chronic wasting disease, or CWD,
was first identified decades ago, and where animal-management practices
may have fueled an epidemic. Now, scientists are conducting research in
the pens and laboratories here in their search for ways to stop it.

They are racing against a disease that has rapidly spread across eight
states and parts of Canada. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has called
CWD an "emergency." In Colorado, sharpshooters, some working from
helicopters, have slaughtered 10,000 deer in the past year trying to
contain its spread. Identified first only in captive animals, it has leapt
the fences, infecting a small but growing number of the nation's more than
20 million free-ranging deer.
...
Though the results came back negative, she'd already had the animal
butchered in the meantime. Since the local butchers tend to give customers
ground meat made from pooled scraps, often there's no guarantee a hunter's
kill won't be mixed with that of an animal that turned up positive for CWD.

"The processor takes scraps and turns it into hamburgers," says Jim
Widmier, the proprietor of Arrow Dynamics, a shop in Fort Collins that
caters to bow hunters. "That is a scary situation. The hamburger and
sausage you get is going to be ground up with other people's."
