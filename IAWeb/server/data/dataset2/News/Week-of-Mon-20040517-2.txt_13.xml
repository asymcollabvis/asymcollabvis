By last November, it was too late. Four times in the previous 15 months,
federal inspectors had cited Sea Life Park on the Hawaiian island of Oahu
for not providing its aging and frail marine mammals with adequate
veterinary care.
...
A South Florida Sun-Sentinel investigation found that the federal
government is slow to enforce laws meant to protect marine mammals and has
allowed violators to continue operating for years even after documenting
contaminated water, starvation or deaths such as Laukani's.
...
It took a complaint from an animal rights activist to bring official
action against the Miami Seaquarium. Last fall, county building inspectors
threatened to shut the park down after documenting 125 code violations,
including some that may have endangered animals, the county's building
chief said.The Seaquarium's last three USDA inspection reports say: "No
non-compliances identified.''
...
For the most part, the lone voice for the marine mammals comes from a
small band of animal rights advocates. Splintered and disorganized, the
activists are dismissed as extremists and fanatics by many politicians and
industry officials.
