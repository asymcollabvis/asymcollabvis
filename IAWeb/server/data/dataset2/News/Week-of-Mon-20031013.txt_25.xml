Franciscan friars of St. Boniface Church in the Tenderloin reverently offered 
their annual Blessing of the Animals ceremony on Sunday afternoon, Oct. 4, to 
dozens of dogs, cats, hamsters, turtles, parakeets, rabbits and other soulful 
beasts who graciously received the sacred prayers and the sprinkling of holy 
water. I saw no serpents here, but I did see four Guardian Angels wearing red 
berets and camouflage pants, plus mayoral candidate Angela Alioto, who 
schmoozed with the pastor. Mingling with the masses, I posed a crucial theological 
question. 
Excuse me, are you Father Floyd Lotito? You organized this event? Is today 
St. Francis of Assisi's birthday? 
Yes, I am Father Lotito. Today is St. Francis' Feast Day. It is actually the 
day that he died in 1226, but it also symbolizes his "birthday" with joining 
God in Heaven. 
St. Francis is the patron saint of animals. He saw all creation as part of a 
family, with animals as his brothers and sisters. There are many stories of 
his friendships with animals. The Wolf of Gubbio was terrorizing people, for 
example, but St. Francis made peace with him through dialogue and conversation. 
Do pets go to Heaven? 
All creation has been elevated through the incarnation of Jesus, and animals 
are part of creation.
