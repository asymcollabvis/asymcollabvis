  <content>Dozens of dogs found last month at two alleged "puppy mills" 
are being nursed back to health at the Grant County Animal Shelter. 
"They're in much better health than they were when they first got here," said 
Wanda Bedard, Grant County animal control officer. "But a lot of them still 
need medical care." 
A grand jury indicted the owners of the kennels Wednesday on 33 counts. A 
preliminary hearing has been set for Feb. 25. Additional charges could be filed 
in Pendleton and Harrison counties. 
Ken Sunbom faces 20 counts of animal cruelty, two counts of theft and two 
counts of receiving stolen property. His ex-wife, Tanya Moukedden Sunbom, was 
charged with six counts of theft, two counts of receiving stolen property and 
with being a persistent felony offender. 
Police brought 128 dogs to the shelter after they were discovered last month 
in squalid conditions at kennels operated by the pair. 
Workers neutered all the dogs and updated their shots. 
Each dog had a tracking microchip implanted under its skin. 
Twelve of the stolen dogs have been claimed and returned to their original 
owners, Bedard said. 
Bill Stewart's dog, Sam, disappeared last April. His collar was found at the 
kennel operated by Moukedden, and she and Sunbom are charged with stealing </content>
