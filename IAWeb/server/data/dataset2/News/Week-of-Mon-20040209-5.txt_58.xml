They see worrisome similarities between this winter and the winter of 
1996-97, which preceded the last surge of human-lion problems. Lions seemed to be 
everywhere then - living under cabins, threatening dogs, stalking horses. They 
were sniffing out the pet food left on Kalispell porches and, occasionally, 
pouncing on pets. 
That record winter had slowed down the deer, and the lions had grown fat on 
easy prey and winter kill. But come spring, about 80 percent of the deer were 
gone, gobbled up by lions and bears and wolves and, most of all, by a long, 
hard winter of deep snow and cold weather. 
Now, "we thought it would be a good idea to get the word out," Fraley said. 
Wenum said people often make the situation worse. Feeding the deer through 
the winter, for example, attracts the deer, but the deer attract lions. 
"Once you establish a regular feeding regimen, deer movements become 
predictable and the deer are more vulnerable to predation," Wenum said in a FWP 
statement. 
He said people can help him by calling at the first sign of a wild cat that's 
not acting so wild. Lions bold enough to hang around people and their pets, 
he said, are lions that might later cause trouble.</content>
