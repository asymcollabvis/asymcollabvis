  <content>Canine smiles and puppy-brown eyes abruptly pop up above the gray 
cement walls as two shelter assistants walk through the back door, touching 
off an instant storm of Morse code-like barking. Several years and hundreds of 
dogs past their first days at the Animal Care Center, Melissa McWhorter and 
Bonnie Berry are accustomed to the exuberant greetings of pound dogs and the 
quiet stares of the cats. 
At the moment their conversation was competing with the chatter of more than 
30 dogs housed at the shelter on Lancaster Road. 
With careful attention from Berry, McWhorter and shelter manager Lois Oliver, 
a little charm and lots of luck, some of the animals might find a new home 
outside the gray room. But it is the dedication and determination of the women 
that plays a big role in sending many animals home. 
Much of what the women do is not a requirement of the job, but rather a 
calling, a labor of love for the animals they temporarily house. McWhorter and 
Berry place pictures of the animals on the walls of Fort Logan Hospital and 
Wal-Mart, advertise them on the radio and in local newspapers, any place a 
prospective pet owner might be. 
And if that is not enough, they take their work home with them. 
"Every animal that we have at home came from here," McWhorter said. 
Between the two assistants, their homes have become habitats for close to 10 
pets. Pictures of many more hang on Berry's refrigerator doors in tandem with 
her daughter's artwork. 
"I look at them and wonder how they're doing. I have a whole stack of them," 
said Berry. "It tickles me to death when they get adopted." </content>
