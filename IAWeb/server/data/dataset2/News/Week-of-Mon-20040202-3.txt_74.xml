Hi. My name is Subject No. 54879 and I live in an animal research lab. 
Although I'm usually a pretty calm mouse - being as I'm nearly always despondent due 
to various experimental drugs - I feel compelled to write in defense of 
animal research. It's about time we get some old-fashioned RESPECT. 
Researchers have long been criticized by organizations like People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals for using furry creatures as test subjects. I can 
recall more than one occasion when I was rudely awakened, not by severe 
cramping following bleach-laced pellets, but by loud protesters just below my window. 
Sometimes these protests last all night; they should be grateful my eyes were 
swollen with hair spray and I couldn't sleep anyway. Otherwise, you can be 
sure they would have been hearing from me. This mouse does not put up with that 
sort of foolishness. No, siree! 
What is most aggravating is that protesters just don't seem to understand 
that animal testing is an honored and effective tradition. Wise up, people! If 
not for brave subjects such as myself, mankind would not be able to enjoy the 
vaccinations, pesticides, artificial sweeteners and cosmetics they do now. And 
forget about moisturized skin, too; that was the result of Granny, No. 37954, 
and the rest of her proud generation. 
When protesters label this as "inhumane" and "brutal," they're spitting on 
the selfless mammals that have contributed to the luxuries humans enjoy daily. 
Frankly, I'm disgusted by their brazen ingratitude and it's time I speak out. </content>
