The Ruckus Society rethinks the U.S. anti-corporate globalization
movement; foregrounds POC leadership, ?anti-oppression analysis?
...
?Close your eyes,? directs a young workshop facilitator. In the sticky
heat of a secluded Florida campground, under a large open-air tent, a
group of activists closes their eyes. ?Now I want you to picture an
anti-corporate globalization activist.? The campers furrow their
collective brows. ?Okay,? says the facilitator, after a brief pause, ?how
many saw a white person??

Over a hundred and fifty activists -- roughly a third of them people of
color -- have gathered in the Florida wetlands from across the hemisphere,
united in opposition to corporate globalization, to participate in a
week-long training camp hosted by the Oakland-based Ruckus Society.
...
The better part of a day was devoted to debate between animal rights
activists (primarily white) and meat eaters (primarily working class and
people of color) after meat was brought into the historically vegetarian
and vegan camp space for the first time, at the demands of many people of
color.

John Taylor, a 25-year-old organizer with the African American
Environmental Justice Action Network in Atlanta, was one of them.

?In America if you have access to resources and wealth you can make a
conscious decision not to eat meat,? says Taylor. ?But if you come from
one of my communities then you eat whatever is given to you, because you
don?t have the luxury to say, ?I don?t want to eat that.?? Taylor, who is
learning puppet construction, political theater, dance, and costume design
as part of the Arts in Action track, also noted that meat is an important
part of many indigenous spiritual traditions. </content>
