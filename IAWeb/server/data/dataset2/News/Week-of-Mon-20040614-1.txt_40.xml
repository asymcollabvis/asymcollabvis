Against all odds, Dennis Kucinich plans to make his presence felt
through next month?s Democratic National Convention and beyond
...
FOR A CANDIDATE who failed to win a single presidential primary, Dennis
Kucinich has an impressively healthy sense of his own importance. Last
month, Kucinich ? the only Democrat other than John Kerry still actively
running ? opened his Democratic National Convention headquarters in a
cramped fourth-floor office on Temple Place, just off Boston Common.
...
Kucinich is a small man with lank, unkempt hair and large ears; rather
than fitting the standard image of a presidential candidate, he looks
like a dour elf ? one whose manner is often brittle and who, for good
measure, just happens to be a vegan.

Still, Kucinich persevered. And though few pundits or voters ever saw
him as a serious contender, his doggedness earned the grudging respect
of some once-skeptical observers.
