Southwest Florida?s top panther experts descended on Caribbean Gardens: The 
Zoo in Naples on Saturday to bring the plight of the endangered species to the 
people. 
As part of Save the Panther Day, organizers from Friends of the Florida 
panther along with wildlife officials from the Florida Panther National Wildlife 
Refuge spent the day at the zoo educating people about the panther and its 
habitat. 
Larry Richardson, a wildlife biologist who works at the refuge, showed people 
how they track panthers with radio collars. He also explained the problems 
panthers are facing with loss of habitat, while giving them the encouraging news 
that there are still about 100 panthers left in Southern Florida. TO JOIN
? What: Friends of the Florida Panther

? Where: Friends of the Florida Panther Refuge, Attn. Treasurer c/o U.S. Fish

?I was very interested just to know that the population has doubled, which is 
really encouraging,? said Anita Zatz of Fort Lauderdale. 
About a decade ago biologists said there were 30 to 50 panthers ? now they 
put the figure at about 100.

surrounding Alligator Alley are helping.
