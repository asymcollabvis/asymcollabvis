  <content>A Spearfish man who owns and operates a specialty meat business 
has been sentenced to serve one year on probation and pay a $3,000 fine, along 
with $8,320 in restitution, for illegally selling bear gall bladders.

Steve Hauff, 50, was sentenced by U.S. Senior District Judge Richard H. 
Battey on April 27. Hauff was originally indicted by a federal grand jury on a 
felony charge more than two years ago, in December 2002, and pleaded guilty to a 
misdemeanor last October.
The misdemeanor charge holds that Hauff should have known the laws involving 
bear gall bladder sales, explained Bob Prieksat, resident agent in charge for 
the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service in Pierre. A felony charge would have 
required that he did know the laws.

Hauff, who founded Prairie Harvest in 1997, was charged with selling bear 
gall bladders to a party in Alaska and with making a false statement in a 
wildlife report after an investigation by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, according 
to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office.
