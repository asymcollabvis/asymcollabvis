City and country tussled Tuesday during a Senate committee hearing on
legislation to ban hog-dog competitions.

Hog-dog supporters told the Senate Committee on Judiciary C that city
folks have no place trying to ban a venerable slice of rural culture that
they say does not harm hogs or the dogs trying to capture them.

Country folks need to give up the "brutal" and "sadistic" competition and
spend the time they save learning to read and write, said Sen. Ken Hollis,
R-Metairie.

Waving literature provided by supporters that contained "page after page"
of misspelled words, Hollis said hog-dog supporters would be better served
if they sat "around and read to each other."
