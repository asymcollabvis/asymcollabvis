Compassionate Action for Animals gave out food on the West Bank plaza in
hopes of taking on some new supporters Monday.

Members of the student group, which has about 70 active members, gave
pamphlets and food to help spread the word about veganism, outreach
coordinator Greg Oschwald, who graduated from the University?s Morris
campus, said.

For some, outreach efforts such as these events turn people away from all
meat and animal products and onto a vegan diet, he said.

Vegan Outreach, an international animal rights activist group, has done
research that shows how students often become vegans after trying vegan
food at outreach events, Oschwald said.

The student group used pamphlets from Vegan Outreach during its event Monday.

Matt Ball, executive director and co-founder of Vegan Outreach, said the
organization focuses on reaching college students.
