In the predawn at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in northeastern South Africa, 
Micaela Szykman stands on a hill with an antenna held in the air, listening for 
signals from the radio collars of African wild dogs. 
If the dogs are within range, Szykman jumps back into her jeep to rendezvous 
with them before they awake. Szykman, a research fellow of the Smithsonian 
National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., is tracking the dogs for the 
Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Predator Project. 
The African wild dog, Lycaon pictus, also called the painted wolf or the Cape 
hunting dog is the victim mainly of human persecution. The dog is listed as 
threatened by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). Lycaon pictus once roamed 
most of sub-Saharan Africa. Now only about 5,000 dogs can be found in isolated 
pockets. 
  

 
In 1914, game hunter R. C. F. Maugham wrote, "It will be an excellent day ? 
when means can be devised ? for this unnecessary creature's complete 
extermination." The maligned African wild dog, which kills by disemboweling, has been 
driven close to extinction. Now efforts are in place to resurrect the species.</content>
