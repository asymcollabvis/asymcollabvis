Accompanied by a neighbor, Deborah Dixon questioned the council and mayor 
Monday evening about dealing with vicious dogs. ?I want to know about the 
amendment about vicious dogs ? on keeping a vicious animal in the city limits of 
Lonoke, Arkansas. It?s out of hand. It?s happened to me, where I live, it?s all 
over town. Someone?s going to get killed,? she told the council.

On March 25, two pit bull terriers broke through a wooden fence and into the 
yard of Deborah Dixon of Fairview Street. The dogs attacked and killed Dixon?s 
Pomeranian, decapitating the smaller dog.

?It?s not just the dog. It could have been my daughter,? she remarked.

Mayor Tom Privett said he is unfamiliar with any requirements in dealing with 
vicious dogs. However, the two pit bulls are in custody and the owner has 
been cited, he said.

?We need to make it a city law that if you have a dog considered in the 
vicious category, it should be registered, and it should be bonded for insurance 
purposes. Because what happened to me, it could have been me. Where I live, they?
re all around, and they are not pets. They are mean, vicious dogs all around,?
 Dixon said.
