Quincy finally has a new animal control ordinance.

The City Council approved the revised document by a 13-1 vote Monday night ? 
nearly two years after a local committee started working on it.

The final version breezed through the council once a controversial 
pet-registration provision was removed last week. The provision would have required pet 
owners to pay $2 to have each dog and cat registered annually. Some aldermen 
were concerned this would have amounted to ?double registration? because 
Quincy pet owners already are required to register their dogs through Adams County.

The provision was dropped after city officials received assurances the city 
will get dog-registration information from the county on a timely basis. The 
city will continue its existing cat registration program, which is conducted at 
no cost to residents.

Deputy Chief Harry Cramer of the Quincy Police Department, who served on the 
committee, said he was pleased to see the council approve the revised 
ordinance.

?It?s a good package as far as we?re concerned,? he said.

The ordinance makes a number of changes in animal control policies. For 
example, it authorizes animal control officers to pick up any cats running loose in 
the city. Formerly, the running-at-large provision applied only to dogs.

Cramer said this is a much-needed change.

?We have a growing cat problem,? he said. ?There are a lot of free-roaming 
cats in the community, and we needed to do something about trying to get a 
handle on that problem.?</content>
