As the United States confronts fears of mad cow disease in
the beef supply, Patrick and Alison tend to their daughter, gently wiping
the drool from her mouth and talking to her in familiar soft tones.

It's hard to imagine Charlene as she was at age 23 and younger. Those
years were filled with a talkative exuberance, since stolen by variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob, or the human version of mad cow disease.
...
Patrick and Alison are originally from England, where they suspect
Charlene ate contaminated beef sometime before 1992. She is one of 129
cases reported in the United Kingdom from October 1996 to November 2002,
according to the World Health Organization.
...
During the weekend, the U.S. government announced that it would give DNA
tests to an infected Washington state cow to determine if it originated
from Canada. If so, the United States could seek a clearance stamp from
the WHO. That would classify the nation free of mad cow since the disease
was found in imported cattle and authorities acted to eradicate it.

Beef industry advocates champion the move as a way to save the millions of
dollars it has lost in the past few weeks because foreign nations have
banned U.S. beef.

Consumer advocates, and Charlene's parents, consider it an outrage.

"We should be testing every cow. If one person gets it here, that's one
too many," said Patrick, who asked that The Herald not print the family's
last name. 
...
"We just want people to be really careful. Consider what they are eating
and how safe it is," Patrick said. "We know there are few people who get
this disease, but the worst thing is to see even one more family go
through this."
