WASHINGTON -- Two years before she confirmed the first U.S. case of mad
cow disease, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman assured concerned consumers
that her agency had halted the infection at the nation's borders.

Evidence, she told news reporters Nov. 30, 2001, came from a study by the
Harvard Center for Risk Analysis showing the risk of mad cow, or BSE,
entering the country was "extremely low." Her assertions became the
foundation of major USDA decisions dealing with mad cow.

But the agency-sponsored study did not assess efforts to keep the disease
out of the United States as Veneman said, The Oregonian has found.
Researchers with the Harvard center, part of the university's School of
Public Health, had spent two years trying to measure the risk that mad cow
might enter the United States before concluding they could not.
