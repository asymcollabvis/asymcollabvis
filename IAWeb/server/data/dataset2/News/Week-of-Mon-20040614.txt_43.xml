The woman known as the "Dog Lady" in Liberty County has no more dogs.

At a hearing Monday, Patsy Boucher, a 58-year-old retired truck driver,
was forced not only to permanently relinquish her 121 dogs; but also
three pigs, three guinea pigs, one cat, seven finches and a cockatiel
that can whistle the theme to The Bridge on the River Kwai.

Justice of the Peace Burl Thomas ordered the animals turned over to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Houston after
investigators testified that Boucher's two-room wooden house and
half-acre lot about 35 miles north of Houston was unfit for both humans
and animals. Precinct 5 Constable L.W. DeSpain said the stench from the
urine and feces inside the house and around the yard was so strong that
he vomited after he entered the property with a warrant to temporarily
seize the animals June 1.

Boucher, who represented herself at Monday's hearing, berated Liberty
County for refusing to spend the money needed to provide an animal
shelter for the many strays dumped in the county's rural areas.

"I have done nothing wrong but take stray dogs off the streets with
nowhere else to go. I admit to being overwhelmed," she said while
crying, "but I have never done anything cruel. I love my dogs. Now
they're going to be euthanized."
