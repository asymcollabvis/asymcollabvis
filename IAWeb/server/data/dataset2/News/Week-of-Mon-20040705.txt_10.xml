AN ANIMAL farm for disabled children will have to find  ?30,000 for security 
fencing to protect its animals after two were  savagely killed. 
Volunteers at Acorn Venture Farm in Kirkby have been  warned by council 
planners that the cheapest form of security fencing is  considered too ugly to pass 
planning requirements. 
The farm needs to improve the fencing after two  pregnant sheep were 
mutilated and killed by thugs - one was strangled and  another had its throat slit and 
leg cut off. 
Now workers at the farm near Knowsley Industrial Estate  claim the council is 
putting them under unnecessary financial strain,  despite having pledged to 
support them. 
Farm manager Fiona Smith said: "We have asked for help  with funding to erect 
security fencing around the vulnerable fields but it  was not forthcoming. 
"We prepared for fencing costs of ?19,000 which would  have to be met through 
the farm's limited funds. 
"Now we have been advised that the standard palisade  security fencing is no 
longer considered acceptable and a more "visually  pleasing" type of fencing 
will have to be erected bringing the total cost  to over ?30,000." 
She added: "This is bureaucracy gone mad; already five  acres of the farm 
site are secured with palisade fencing. We are only a  small charity and ?30,000 
is well beyond our  budget."
