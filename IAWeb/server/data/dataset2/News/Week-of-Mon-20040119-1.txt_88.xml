More than 1,000 tiger pawprints have been found in a six-day census of the 
Sunderban marshlands of east India, indicating a slight rise in numbers of the 
endangered animal, a forestry official said. 
"More than 1,000 impression of pugmarks (pawprints) have been collected this 
time," Atanu Raha, chief conservator of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve, told 
reporters here late Monday. "This year's census has indicated an encouraging 
trend. We have found some prints of young tigers too. It not only indicates 
stability in the numbers of the big cats, but also indicates that the tiger 
population is on the rise." 
At the last count two years ago, 950 pawprints were screened, with wildlife 
experts concluding that the reserve had about 271 tigers. The Sunderbans is a 
delta region of the mighty Ganga river, spreading across 52 islands near the 
Bay of Bengal off the southern tip of India's West Bengal state and neighbouring 
Bangladesh. Lurking in the thick mangrove forests interwined by 
criss-crossing creeks, the tiger is known to occasionally jump on to boats to pick up human 
beings and then swim through the marshes with its kill. </content>
