  <content>Producers who think the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recent 
announcement of stricter regulations on cattle processing and products 
containing animal material won't affect their operations much, should think again.

The fallout could hit producers in ways they haven't thought of yet.

In light of the single-case discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in 
a Washington state dairy cow -- one of Canadian origin -- the USDA has ramped 
up its regulations regarding cattle processing. Those include how cattle are 
killed and butchered and what carcass parts can be used in what manner. 
Increased limitations are now hovering snugly over material headed for both human and 
animal consumption and human health and beauty products. 
The Jan. 26 release of the interim rules left no doubt that renderers' 
markets would tighten, with the backlash of the BSE discovery felt almost 
immediately since that news went public Dec. 23, said Neil Katchen of Darling 
International, a renderer with operations in Twin Falls and Boise.

"It's a very difficult time in our industry right now. Some places, it's 
impossible to sell," the company's executive vice president of operations said in 
today's edition of Ag Weekly.

In addition to market chaos on how meat , bone meal and tallow will fit into 
the stricter regulations, more than 40 countries banned all U.S. beef products 
following the BSE discovery.
