Two students established an organization last Friday in an effort to spark 
campus awareness of equine cruelty and gain support for a bill outlawing horse 
slaughter. 

Students Against the Slaughter of Horses (SASH) is dedicated to getting 
students invovled in the movement to prevent the ongoing slaughter of horses in the 
United States for human consumption in foreign countries, said club president 
and founder Amanda Karkula, sophomore in ACES.

"A lot of people don't know where their horses are going when they sell them 
at auctions," Karkula said. "Middlemen, or 'killer buyers,' buy these cheap 
horses for slaughtering companies." 

A slaughtering plant in DeKalb, Ill., is currently under renovation after 
being destroyed by a fire two years ago, Karkula said. If reopened, Caval 
International will be one of three horse-slaughtering plants operating in the United 
States. Two others are located in Texas. 

Thousands of horses are slaughtered each year, Karkula said. There were 
42,312 horses killed in the United States for human consumption overseas in 2002, 
according to United States Department of Agriculture records. That number does 
not include horses that were transported across borders into Canada and Mexico </content>
