April 19 issue - Before getting his big idea, William von Hippel sat through 
an otherwise unexceptional lecture on traditional Chinese medicine in 1997. As 
China adopts Western habits?sedentary jobs, stressful urban lives, poor diets?
its citizens are also picking up Western afflictions. Cases of impotence are 
on the rise, and so is the demand for traditional cures like seal penises, sea 
horses, geckos and other exotic ingredients that many Chinese believe confer 
virility. The problem: the growing demand for these ingredients is driving 
many species of wildlife to the brink of extinction. Von Hippel, a psychologist 
at the University of New South Wales in Australia, was intrigued enough to 
visit apothecaries in Hong Kong and Beijing, where he saw a bewildering array of 
dried penises in all shapes and sizes. Then, in 1998, Viagra made its debut in 
the West.

Later that year, while von Hippel was hiking near Anchorage with his brother 
Frank, a biologist at the University of Alaska, the siblings decided to write 
a letter to the journal Science, proposing that this pill, at $10 a pop, could 
quell demand for "animal sexual potency products" and prove a boon not only 
for Chinese men but for endangered species. To their surprise, Science 
published the letter even though "we had no data," says William. When the brothers 
followed up with studies, they found a decline in the poaching of Canadian seals 
and Alaskan reindeer (killed for their antlers, a traditional Chinese cure) 
that they attributed partly to Viagra. If Viagra caught on among Asians, they 
argued, it could be an effective conservation solution.</content>
