The genetically engineered pet appears to have arrived. 
In a development that is likely to inspire both fascination and alarm, a 
Texas company said Monday that it would soon start selling a genetically 
engineered aquarium fish that glows in the dark. 
The GloFish, as it is called, is a zebra fish containing a gene from a sea 
coral that makes the fish bright red under normal light and fluorescent under 
ultraviolet light. Zebra fish, about an inch-and-a-half long, are normally 
silver and black. 
The company selling the fish, Yorktown Technologies, of Austin, calls the 
fish ?a miracle of science? and said sales would begin on January 5 through pet 
stores. 
Genetic engineering of animals has until now been performed mainly for 
scientific research or medical purposes, for instance to make mice that get a 
certain disease. Making glow-in-the-dark fish extends the technology into the realm 
of human amusement, which might raise some eyebrows. Indeed, an artist who 
made a glow-in-the-dark rabbit a few years ago as an artwork attracted criticism 
for undermining the dignity of life for trivial purposes. 
Some environmental groups, led by the Center for Food Safety in Washington, 
are trying to delay the sale of the fish for another reason, saying it should 
first be reviewed by federal regulators. The groups say the fish might enter 
natural waterways if people dump out their aquariums and upset the natural 
balance in ecosystems.
