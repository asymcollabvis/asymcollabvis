THALAND: The great round-up of stray dogs in Phuket destined for the island?s 
new dog pound will start on Monday and is expected to continue until August 
11.

Phuket Provincial Livestock Office (PPLO) Chief Sunart Wongchawalit announced 
the plan at a meeting with other provincial officials yesterday at the Phuket 
Provincial Hall.

More than 1,000 stray dogs will be brought to Baan Pak Sunak Phuket (Phuket 
Rest Home for Dogs), the controversial new facility in the Ban Suan Khanoon 
area of Thalang District. The pound?s capacity is 2,000 animals, K. Sunart said.

?With the cooperation of Phuket?s 19 local administrations, we will catch 
stray dogs in tourism areas first. Each locality will be assigned two or three 
dates over the period during which to deliver the animals. Once delivered, the 
dogs will be separated by sex, sterilized and vaccinated,? he said.
K. Sunart said that of the island?s estimated 14,000 dogs, only about 4,000 
are true strays.

He said dog owners should come and register their animals with their local 
administrations [to prevent them from being picked up]. He added that in the 
future the PPLO plans to implant microchips in all registered dogs, but that 
there is currently no budget for such a project.

The cost of each microchip is 180 baht, and he estimates that about 9,000 of 
the devices will be needed. The PPLO will schedule a public hearing to discuss 
dog control regulations after the new dog pound is in operation, he said.
