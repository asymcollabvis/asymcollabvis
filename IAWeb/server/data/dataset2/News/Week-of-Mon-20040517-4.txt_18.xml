Animal-control and humane officials from across Southern California have
joined forces with customs agents to stop smugglers from hauling hundreds
of sick Mexican puppies into the state.

Since the agencies began sharing information in April, customs officers
daily have turned back 10 to 20 vehicles, each carrying as many as three
dozen puppies headed across the border for quick resale, said Lt. Mary Kay
Gagliardo with San Diego County's Department of Animal Services.
...
Two weeks ago at the border, her department confiscated 34 small-breed
pups and three exotic birds, she said. Some puppies, only 3 weeks old when
they were seized, now are dying from the highly contagious parvovirus.

Moreno Valley Animal Services is investigating several complaints from
people who have bought sick puppies from private sellers, including one
who admitted getting puppies in Mexico.
