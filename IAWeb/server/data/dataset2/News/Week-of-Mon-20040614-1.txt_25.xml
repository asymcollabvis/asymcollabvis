The fate of a dog that mauled a 3-year-old boy last year will remain in limbo 
until September, when a court decides whether it will hear new testimony. 
The City of Toronto wants the dog to be put down, while the Toronto Humane 
Society is fighting the order and wants the dog kept alive. But outside court 
yesterday, a humane society worker called the dog "a loaded gun waiting to off." 
And in an odd twist, the city has subpoenaed seven new witnesses from the 
humane society to testify about the behaviour of the dog, a pit bull-Labrador 
cross. 
Yesterday, Justice of the Peace Patrick Deacon told lawyers for both sides 
that he wanted to reserve his decision to give him time to review case law on 
whether to hear from the new witnesses.
