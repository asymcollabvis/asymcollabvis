The 2003 Perry County Animal Control numbers have been totaled and the 
results are bittersweet.
The progress to reduce the number of adoptable animals euthanised at the 
animal control facility has improved in leaps and bounds since Perry County Humane 
Society has stepped in to make a difference.
If you remember from 2002, the total brought in was around 530 and total 
adopted was around 30!
That means the society is saving 43% more animals than the year before. The 
Perry County Humane Society are not the only hard-working individuals that have 
taken part in this endeavor. The Perry County Humane Society would like to 
thank Lonnie James (past Animal Control Officer), Scott Hagene (current Animal 
Control Officer), and Angie Adams (kennel care-taker).
Everyone in Perry County can help in this effort in a few simple ways: 1. 
Spay/Neuter your pets! This is the only way we can assure to lower the numbers of 
unwanted animals that are brought into the facility. It also ensures a 
healthy and happy lifestyle for your animal. This one-time vet expense can save you 
money and time in the long run not having to worry about an unwanted litter. 
2. Support your local Humane Society by either volunteering a couple hours a 
week or by sending donations of money and supplies.</content>
