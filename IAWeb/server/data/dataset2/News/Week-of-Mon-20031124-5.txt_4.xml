Willie F. Ivory hasn't had a dog in years.
Doesn't matter.
He's still donating his time as a construction manager to give homeless 
pooches new digs in the Fine-Soffer Adoption Center for the Humane Society of 
Greater Miami in North Miami.
''When you see those stray animals and they are so lost . . .,'' his voice 
trails off before he resumes forcefully, ``they need someone to care for them 
and get them sheltered.''
Ivory, 61, a certified general contractor and construction manager for 
Turnberry Associates, counts himself as that someone -- just as he has for a North 
Miami blind man needing his home renovated, a disabled Perrine couple needing 
their home painted inside and out, even his New Birth Baptist congregation 
needing an overseer to build their 56,000-square-foot megachurch.
For the latter, Ivory estimates he saved the church $1.5 million to $2 
million by waiving his usual fees as general contractor. That's in addition to the 
10 percent of his income he tithes to New Birth every year.
''To me, that's not negotiable,'' he says of his tithe.
Ivory chairs the 32-member regional board of the South Florida Workforce, an 
agency that helps 200,000 people a year in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties find 
jobs. He also is co-chair of the Dade School Readiness Coalition and a member 
of the board of the Northwest Boys &amp; Girls Club.
Earlier this month, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and county commissioners 
were so impressed with Ivory's volunteering that they named Nov. 7 as Willie F. 
Ivory Day.</content>
