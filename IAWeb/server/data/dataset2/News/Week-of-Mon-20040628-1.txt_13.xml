Dallas Davis, wanted by Waynesboro police since January in a cruelty case  
involving a dog left in a trash bin with broken legs, was arrested Monday while  
in court in Chambersburg, Pa., on unrelated charges, authorities said.  
Davis, 36, formerly of 807 W. Main St., and his girlfriend at the time,  
Sharon K. Black, 43, of the same address, were charged with animal cruelty in  the 
case.  
Both face up to five years in prison if convicted.  
Davis also was charged with making terroristic threats.  
The dog - a young, white, female mongrel - was found scared and whimpering in 
 a trash bin at the Landis Gardner factory on East Sixth Street by a company  
security guard.  
The dog had two broken front legs. Makeshift splints fashioned from a broken  
ruler and duct tape were on her legs. A veterinarian who treated the dog  
determined that her legs were broken deliberately, court  records said.
