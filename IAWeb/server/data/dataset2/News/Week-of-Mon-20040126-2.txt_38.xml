THE VIRUSES that cause bird flu, SARS, and Ebola formerly affected only 
animals. For some reason, they crossed the border between species, and they 
infected humans. Mad cow disease traveled in the opposite direction. It crossed from 
humans to animals and back again.

 
Mad cow disease was originally caused by human cannibalism. A small tribe in 
New Zealand ate their dead relatives as a sign of love and respect for them. 
They ate everything, including the brains, where the virus multiplied. Somehow, 
the virus crossed to animals.

Because of man's greed for profit, ranchers rendered dead animals to feed to 
the grass-eating sheep. The extra protein made them grow faster and fatter. 
Thus, the virus of the disease was transferred to them. The same thing happened 
to cattle. In feed lots where cattle from the ranches were fattened, they were 
fed protein from corn, soybeans-mixed with rendered dead animals. (Rendering 
is a process by which animals are boiled in huge vats until the fat melts and 
the tissues break down. The resulting brew is then dried and mixed with animal 
feed.)

The virus punches holes in the brains of the animals so that they stagger 
about like crazy until they fall and die, hence the term "mad cow" disease.

Ebola used to be confined to monkeys. Primitive African tribes, who hunted 
wild animals for food, including monkeys, got the disease from them. Ebola is a 
horrible disease. The victim bleeds and rots from the inside-literally. Blood 
oozes out of every orifice in the body. This ooze is very contagious. 
Laboratories in the United States that used monkeys for their experiments had to kill 
all the monkeys in their compounds.</content>
