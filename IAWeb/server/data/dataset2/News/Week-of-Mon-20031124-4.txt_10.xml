Francisco and Sheila were ideal parents. They raised 25 babies, taught them 
good survival skills, and sent many of them off to live on their own.

Francisco and Sheila were Mexican grey wolves, or lobos, part of a breeding 
programme in Eureka, 32km south-west of St Louis. Although captive themselves, 
Francisco and Sheila taught their pups such good wolf traits that many are 
thriving in the wild.

Francisco and Sheila were pioneers in a US federal programme to restore the 
endangered Mexican grey wolf, the rarest and most genetically distinct 
subspecies of grey wolf in North America. After more than a century of assault by 
humans, by the 1970s its population had dwindled to a handful in its natural range 
in Mexico and the south-west of America.

Nine of Francisco and Sheila's offspring were among the first 11 captive-born 
Mexican grey wolves released in 1998. Both parent wolves have since died - 
Francisco at age 14 in December, Sheila at age 16 in June 2000 - but they lived, 
as captive wolves often do, roughly twice as long as wolves in the wild. 
Today, the Wild Canid Survival &amp; Research Centre in Eureka estimates that 98% of 
Mexican wolves released in
the federal programme are descendants of the prolific lobo pair.

"They're true heroes," says Kim Bishop-Scott, assistant director of the 
centre. "So many of (their) offspring actually made it into the wild. They 
sacrificed their freedom for future generations."</content>
