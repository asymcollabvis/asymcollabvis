Animal Control Agencies Hail Mount Airy Operation For Equine Expertise 

The new arrivals were in critical shape. The mother's backbone was a 
prominent, knobby ridge, her ribs starkly outlined. The two-week-old was covered with 
open sores and so weak it was uncertain he would live another day. 
The horses received immediate treatment and were monitored through that first 
anxious night. Three months later, American Allie, as the chestnut mare is 
called, has gained more than 200 pounds and Zepplin, her colt, is a 
rambunctious, newly weaned three-month-old. In a few months, they will go to new homes and 
new adoptive owners, shedding their past lives at a Prince George's County 
farm. Allan and Kathleen Schwartz will see to that. 
The couple operates Days End Farm Horse Rescue, the refuge of last resort for 
some of the sorriest victims of animal abuse and neglect in Maryland. Animal 
control officers across the state call for help from the 14-year-old operation 
in western Howard County when they seize horses whose owners are accused of 
endangering their animals. 
It's a problem that's growing with the state's sizable equine population, now 
estimated at more than 87,000. Although there are rescue operations in 
Maryland that take retired racehorses or buy horses to save them from 
slaughterhouses, only Days End has forged a close partnership with animal control and 
emergency response agencies. 
Before Days End, "we made do, but not as well as we do with Days End," said 
Charles County Animal Control Chief Ed Tucker.
