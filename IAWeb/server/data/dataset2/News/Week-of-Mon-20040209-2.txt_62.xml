At the risk of sounding like a liberal, I am going to present this
argument. As you read it, I hope that you will understand as I do...it is
not a liberal nor a conservative issue, rather one of common sense and
decency. Just in case you are wondering...I detest PETA and I eat meat
(just like my dogs!).

The cruel practice of testing new pharmaceuticals and cosmetic products on
animals must stop and I believe I have a viable replacement. There is not
one person of conscience who could visit an animal testing facility
without deciding that it is wrong. At the same time, there is not one
reasonable person who could visit a maximum security prison and agree that
rapists, murderers, drug dealers, and child molesters deserve a
comfortable life, or that they should simply be warehoused until they die,
or released to bring about more harm. 
...
Our bloated prison population is growing everyday and it is not for the
reasons that liberals traditionally offer. The fact is that evil is
becoming more and more prevalent in this society, as is a lack of personal
responsibility. Testing on animals is an evil that must end and testing on
violent criminals is a way to truly make these thugs pay their debt to
society.
