10 People Face Total Of 88 Charges
POSTED: 11:11 AM EST February 5, 2004
Six people were arrested in and around Baker County Thursday morning, and the 
Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission has warrants for four others 
in connection with numerous crimes against wildlife. 
Two of the suspects -- both women -- were also charged with selling 
moonshine. 
The arrest warrants were issued after an the undercover investigation into 
the illegal sale of fish and wildlife by FWC officers posing as local hunters 
and fishermen. 
"The sale of game animals and fish is illegal," FWC Maj. Gary Strickland said 
in a statement. "There is no commercial harvest of these recreational 
resources. If this was allowed, it could deplete our natural resources that FWC is 
working to preserve for our recreational users." 
Florida Alcohol, Beverage and Tobacco agents were brought into the 
investigation after undercover officers reported several purchases of illegal moonshine 
whiskey during the investigation. 
The majority of the charges are fish and wildlife cases, totaling 67 first- 
and second-degree misdemeanors and 21 felonies. </content>
