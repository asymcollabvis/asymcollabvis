Norwegian whalers set sail for the Barents Sea on Monday as they kicked
off this year's hunt for minke whales, defying an international moratorium
and angry protests from environmentalists.
...
The Global Anti-Whaling Campaign, an umbrella organisation of some 140
international associations, has meanwhile criticised the Norwegian method
of killing whales.

The whalers use harpoons tipped with grenades, meant to deliver a fatal
nervous shock as they detonate inside a whale's body. Animal rights
activists have described the method as "real torture".
