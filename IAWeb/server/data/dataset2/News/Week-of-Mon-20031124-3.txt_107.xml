This Christmas, why not cuddle up with a furry friend while giving the gift 
of life to an endangered species? 
World Wildlife Federation Canada has come up with an unusual gift idea: For 
$40 you can "adopt" a living tiger, one of the world's most endangered species. 
More than 95 per cent of the world's tigers have been lost from the wild, 
according to WWF Canada statistics. The 5,000 tigers still in existence have the 
odds of survival stacked against them as the result of illegal hunting and 
destruction of their habitat. 
WWF Canada is asking for help in its preservation efforts, which have already 
helped double the Bengal tiger population and helped the Siberian tiger 
population grow from just 40 in the 1940s to more than 350 today. 
As proud "parents," your adoption kit includes an acknowledgement of your 
gift, which will help fund WWF Canada efforts to put an end to illegal hunting 
and protect tiger habitats. 
You'll also receive a personalized adoption certificate, a $30 tax receipt 
and a plush, tiger cub toy from the Russ toy company. 
A $10 courier charge may apply. Order online at the WWF's Web site or call 
1-866-2-SAVE-ME (272-8363). 
WWF Canada also has similar adoption programs for polar bears, dolphins and 
wolves, with the adoption kits featuring plush toy versions of these endangered 
species.</content>
