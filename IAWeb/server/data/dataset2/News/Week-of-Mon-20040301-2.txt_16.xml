We saw this in the recent phony "Jobs Creation Act." We are seeing it
again in the "Livestock Siting Bill" (AB 868) which is currently churning
through the Wisconsin's legislature. This bill will facilitate the
establishment of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), also
known as "factory farms," and will restrict, if not eliminate, the ability
of local government to limit those operations.

Factory farms/CAFOs can only operate if they have a Wisconsin Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permit. These farms are regulated
under the Federal Clean Water Act and state water law because of their
potential to negatively impact water resources. The WPDES permit regulates
where and how much waste can be spread on fields, how the waste is
temporarily stored in lagoons, and the design of a permanent runoff
control system. It's a fairly simple matter of regulating the amount of
cow or piggy poo that will get into your well water or nearby creek.
