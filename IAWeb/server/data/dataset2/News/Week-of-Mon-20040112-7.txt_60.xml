A conflict dividing a shelter owner and some of her neighbors might prove 
that even good fences don't make make good neighbors when one side of the fence 
leads to million-dollar homes and the other contains 130 dogs of every 
conceivable size, shape and color. 
Property owners who live near Rory Walter's All Creatures Home for Animals in 
Baileys Harbor are claiming that her shelter has devalued their properties by 
creating an eyesore, a nuisance, a safety hazard and a public health problem. 
Walter, 53, said the concerns are unfounded and have been crafted to hide the 
real reasons for the claims: The neighbors who are complaining don't want to 
live next to an animal shelter, are intolerant of different lifestyles and 
will do whatever they can to get her out of there. </content>
