Volunteer firefighters at Shippensburg's Cumberland Valley Hose Company
looked beyond bingo and the community fair for their latest money maker.

They're banking on thrill of snakes. Rattlesnakes.

Fire Chief Chris Helm, a snake hunter and member of the Keystone Reptile
Club, announced the snake hunt and sacking contest on Friday -- nearly
three months ahead of the event and a couple of weeks before the state
decides whether to issue a permit for the event.

Firefighters say they are expecting controversy and even welcome a visit
from animal rights activists.

Andrea Cimino, wildlife campaign manager with the Humane Society of the
United States in Washington, D.C., said society investigators have visited
snake roundups in Pennsylvania and Texas. She said she is not aware that
any Pennsylvania roundup has been the site of public protest, but the
society still worries for the snakes. 
...
Committeeman Mike Weimer said that he had preferred dead snakes to live
ones before he was dragged off to a snake hunt.

"I got to touch a snake," Weimer said. "I became more respectful and
understanding. I wouldn't have gotten that if I hadn't gone on the snake
hunt."</content>
