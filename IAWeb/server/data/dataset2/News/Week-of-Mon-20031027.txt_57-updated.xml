In response to the letters
regarding Global Ways tropical fish shipments, Global Ways spokeman blamed an inexperienced
packer in South America for problems in a very few shipments. "We are working
with these customers and have guaranteed them satisfaction. A problem occurred
in a very small number of the 5000 shipments we handled last quarter. We regret any 
inconveniences and remain dedicated to providing the highest quality service."
