About 25 Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep listened to their bellies rather than 
their brains Wednesday and were lured to a meal of hay and mashed apples, 
hand-delivered by state wildlife officers. 

For one of the sheep, it would be a fatal mistake. 

The sheep mowed down the goodies that were laid out in a flat spot tucked in 
a little canyon off the Fryingpan River about five miles from Basalt. Red 
cliffs soared hundreds of feet above the feeding grounds. The entire landscape was 
covered with a thick blanket of snow. 

The mix of rams, lambs and ewes that came to the Colorado Division of Wildlife
?s party were oblivious to the net hovering over their heads. 

One second it was the picture of tranquility. The next, all hell broke loose. 

When a game warden tripped the switch that dropped the net, most of the sheep 
stayed upright and desperately tried to sprint away from the horde of humans 
that emerged from behind vehicles and barriers. 

Most of the sheep ended up in a massive tangle of hoofs, legs, horns and 
muzzles. The heads and necks of some struggling animals were twisted at awkward 
angles. The scene looked like a mosh pit at a punk-rock concert, or a peculiar 
game of Twister. </content>
