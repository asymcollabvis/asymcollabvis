The SPCA is to prosecute a member of a Durban North school governing body and 
his teenaged son for the alleged "callous killing" of an Egyptian goose.

The killing, in the school grounds during the holidays, has outraged 
residents.

One resident, Leon Roux, yesterday called on Tony Jordaan, headmaster of 
Northwood Boys' High, to "denounce this act in the strongest possible terms during 
assembly and to emphasise to pupils that wildlife is precious".

He further urged the headmaster to boot the father off the governing body and 
even ban him from entering the school, and to summon the son to his office to 
tell him he could be expelled.

Neither the headmaster nor the father could be contacted for comment 
yesterday.

Letters to local newspapers told how the father allegedly handed a pellet gun 
to a youth - believed to be his son - and instructed him to shoot two geese. 
After missing the first bird, a letter writer said, five shots were fired at 
the second goose.</content>
