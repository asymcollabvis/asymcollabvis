Cattle Killed In Farm Fire

It was a story you saw first on 3. 52 cows are dead, &amp; a house is 
destroyed. The man deputies believe, is responsible, is in custody. All 
that remains of the house is smoking debris. The man, who deputies say, 
burned down the house &amp; killed all his cattle is in jail, held without 
bail. He faces multiple charges including arson, reckless endangerment and 
animal cruelty. 54-year old Chester Gigliuto is the owner of the house. 
Deputies continue to investigate exactly what led this farmer to commit 
these terrible crimes. Investigator Mark Helms of the Cortland County 
Sheriff's Department says, "basically at this point it looks to be 
primarily a financial situation and that this was the only way he felt he 
could deal with it." Gigliuto was renting the house to 3 adults They are 
23-year old, Robert Keegan, 18-year old, Michel Croghan, and Gigliuto's 
stepson, 21-year old Joseph Lavancha. Lavancha spent part of the day 
sifting through the smokey rubble. He told Action News that his stepfather 
warned him that he had plans to destroy the house. He says Gigliuto was 
very much in debt. The people were in the process of removing their 
belongings from the house but they were too late. Yesterday morning, when 
no one was home, gigliuto poured gallons of fuel on the first and second 
floors of the house and set it on fire. But that wasn't the only thing 
gigliuto destroyed yesterday. Deputies say he also told them that he 
killed all 52 of his cattle using a rifle. Gigliuto was leasing a barn 
just about a mile and a half from the house where he kept the cows. David 
Perry is the owner of the property. He says it's a sad situation ...all 
the animals were shot in the head.
