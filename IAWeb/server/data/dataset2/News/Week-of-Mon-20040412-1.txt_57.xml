Joe Tedesco likes watching the wildlife outside his Dishman Hills home.

Tedesco feeds the deer at several backyard feeders, even keeping the water 
trough heated in the winter to prevent it from freezing.

Though he doesn't name the deer, he has come to recognize each one. So when 
a large buck suddenly disappeared, Tedesco decided to investigate. And what 
he found angered him.

One of his neighbor's relatives had killed the buck with a bow and arrow. 
And though the rocky land j
ust west of the Spokane Valley city limits is a no-shooting area, the hunt 
was legal.

"They're quite tame, like pets, and come around every day," Tedesco said. 
"You can stand within 20 feet of these animals. They'll look at you while 
they wait for you to put the feed out."

But while firing guns and rifles is banned in no-shooting areas in 
unincorporated Spokane County, archery is allowed. Archery is prohibited in 
the county's more densely populated incorporated areas.

And because the buck was taken during the proper hunting season last fall, 
with the proper permits and on Tedesco's neighbor's property, no law was 
broken.

Tedesco, a hunter himself, said he would never shoot a deer near a feeder.

"You can feed them and shoot them at the feeder, which shouldn't be. It's 
not a fair chase," he said. "It's like shooting your dog."

Neighbor Tom Rockroth doesn't understand what the fuss is about.</content>
