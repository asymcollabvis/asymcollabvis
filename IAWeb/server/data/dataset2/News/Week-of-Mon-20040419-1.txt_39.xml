ASPCA Special Investigator Annemarie Lucas hugs goat found neglected in 
Brooklyn garage yesterday. Another goat was found dead at the property. 

A Brooklyn homeowner got the goat of humane officers when he tried to turn 
his garage into a barnyard, authorities said yesterday. 
Agents responding to a report of "two lambs" at an undisclosed address found 
a dehydrated goat wandering around inside a garage, said ASPCA Special Agent 
Joseph Pentangelo. Nearby, they found a 4-foot-long crate containing three 
hens, two pigeons, and the remains of another goat and two more pigeons, he said. 
"We don't know why they had these animals," said Pentangelo. "It's 
undetermined whether they were keeping them for food or whether they were pets. But the 
fact that there were three dead animals there is certainly cause for concern."
