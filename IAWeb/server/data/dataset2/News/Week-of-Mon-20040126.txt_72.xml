"Shelter Dogs"

"What happens to the approximately five million abandoned and unwanted dogs
who end up in shelters across the U.S. each year? Only a quarter of
America's shelter dogs ever find new homes, presenting a murky moral debate
for those who care for the leftovers.

"Through a unique window into an upstate New York shelter, this documentary
takes a hard, bold look at a tough dilemma.

"Premieres Tuesday, January 27th at 7:30pm ET/PT"
