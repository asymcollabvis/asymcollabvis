WHEN A single cow with mad cow disease was discovered in Washington state
last month, the National Cattlemen?s Beef Association (NCBA) lost no time
at all. NCBA lobbyists were on the phone to members of Congress--at their
home numbers, because they had left Washington for the holidays.

The association paid for teams of experts in all 50 states to feed news
media reassuring words about the safety of U.S. beef. In short, a massive
campaign not to protect U.S. consumers, but U.S. beef industry profits.

The cattle barons of the NCBA insist that beef is safe, that the cow in
Washington is an isolated case, that Canada is to blame anyway and that
the system is working just as it should. But the truth is that the system
is working as it always has--to protect their profits above all else.

For years, the beef industry ignored all the warnings of scientists and
health organizations, instead spending millions to buy political influence
and to staff regulatory agencies with cattle industry loyalists. No less
than Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman is a former NCBA lobbyist.

Dr. Stanley Prusiner, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who first
identified mad cow disease, met with Veneman almost two months ago--a
meeting he had sought ever since Canada discovered an infected cow last
May. "I went to tell her that what happened in Canada was going to happen
in the United States," Dr. Prusiner told the New York Times. "I told her
it was just a matter of time."</content>
