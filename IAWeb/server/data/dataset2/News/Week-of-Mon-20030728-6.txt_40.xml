THE McDonald's Corporation wants to be everywhere that children are.

So besides operating 13,602 restaurants in the United States, it has
plastered its golden arches on Barbie dolls, video games, book jackets and
even theme parks.

McDonald's calls this promotion and brand extension. But, a growing number
of nutritionists call it a blitzkrieg that perverts children's eating habits
and sets them on a path to obesity.

Marketing fast food, snacks and beverages to children is at least as old as
Ronald McDonald himself. What's new, critics say, is the scope and intensity
of the assault. Big food makers like McDonald's and Kraft Foods Inc. are
finding every imaginable way to put their names in front of children. And
they're spending more than ever - $15 billion last year, compared with $12.5
billion in 1998, according to research conducted at Texas A&amp;M University in
College Station.

"What really changed over the last decade is the proliferation of electronic
media," says Susan Linn, a psychologist who studies children's marketing at
Harvard's Judge Baker Children's Center. "It used to just be
Saturday-morning television. Now it's Nickelodeon, movies, video games, the
Internet and even marketing in schools."
