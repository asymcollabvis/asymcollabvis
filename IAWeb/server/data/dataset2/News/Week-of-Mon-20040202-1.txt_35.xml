It?s getting out of hand

A woman who called around lunchtime on Friday had so much to say that she was 
cut off by the Red Phone?s two-minute time limit. However, not to be 
deterred, she called back a little while later after ruminating more on the issue.

Her first call was prompted by a woman who last week wanted to give her ?two 
cents? worth? on the issue, and asked people not to judge all young people 
because of the bad behavior of a few.

?I think she needs to put more than that into it,? said Friday?s caller. ?
She needs to think more about what the Earth is like if people like her think 
only a little bit of damage can be done by a few.

?Most important, the killing of animals is wrong, it?s very wrong,? she said 
with conviction. ?A child cannot learn unless an adult shows them it?s wrong.
?

When she called back, it was more than an hour later, and it was obvious that 
this matter had been on her mind the whole time, as she asked, ?What will 
become of us humans??

She suggested that people visit animals at a shelter and ?look into their 
eyes.? 

?We need to make the world a better place to live in for us and animals,? 
she said. ?Atrocities can start with just one person.?</content>
