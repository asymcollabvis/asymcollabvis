A mad cow disease epidemic in France went completely undetected and led
to almost 50,000 severely infected animals entering the food chain,
according to a shocking report by French government researchers.

More than 300,000 cows contracted BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)
in the past 13 years, 300 times more than the number of officially
recorded cases, say researchers at France's official Institute of Health
and Medical Research (Inserm).

Their report reveals that while blustering French politicians blamed
Britain for the emergence of the disease - and attempted to create a
cordon sanitaire by banning imports of British beef - they failed to
adopt measures to prevent a hidden epidemic at home.
