  <content>A mountain lion has been spotted twice this month by residents in a 
new townhouse development in west Dublin, prompting park and sheriff's 
officials to distribute fliers warning residents in the area. 
The latest sighting was reported Monday to animal control officers by 
residents near Brigadoon Way and McPeak Lane. A lion was first reported Jan. 11 in 
the same area. 
Since then, animal control officers have been called out to collect the 
carcasses of three does in the area, including one on Wednesday. However, all were 
determined to have died of natural causes, said Tony Owens of the Alameda 
County Sheriff's Animal Control Office. 
This is the first mountain lion spotting in west Dublin since the area has 
been developed, said Steve Bobzien, ecological services coordinator for the East 
Bay Regional Park District. 
He said mountain lions also have been spotted this month in Robert Sibley 
Preserve in the Oakland Hills, and in Anthony Chabot Park in Castro Valley. </content>
