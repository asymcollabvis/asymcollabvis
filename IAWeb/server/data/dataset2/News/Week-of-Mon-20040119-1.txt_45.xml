The Knoxville Zoo's two new tigers are something special. 
It's easy to see how Kali, a 6-year-old bought from the Nashville Zoo, is 
different. Kali's coat is white; she is the zoo's second white tiger. The park's 
other white tiger, Ravi, is 16. 




The zoo's other new tiger wears a common orange coat. But 3-year-old Tevy is 
one of only 37 of her species in U.S. zoos. 
Currently visitors can see Kali in an exhibit near the park's wild dogs and 
cheetah habitats. Kali and her white older relative will not be exhibited 
together. They will alternate time on exhibit starting this spring after Ravi's 
habitat is expanded. 
Tevy is an Indochinese tiger, a smaller species of the endangered big cat. 
She lives in her own exhibit, near the zoo's gibbons. Loaned to Knoxville, she 
arrived from Chaffee Zoo in Fresco, Calif.
