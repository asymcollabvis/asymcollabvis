An animal rights organization Wednesday called on Florida Attorney General
Charlie Crist to investigate alleged cocaine use at dog tracks across the
state, including the Fort Myers-Naples track in Bonita Springs.

The Bonita track leads the state with 10 greyhounds testing positive for
cocaine during the past three years, said Christine A. Dorchak, vice
president of the national GREY2K USA greyhound protection organization
headquartered in Somerville, Mass.

Overall, 119 dogs at Florida?s 18 greyhound tracks have tested positive
for cocaine during that time period, she said.

Her group and The Humane Society of the United States are asking Crist to
conduct a special investigation into the problem so that both the dogs and
the public are protected, Dorchak said.
