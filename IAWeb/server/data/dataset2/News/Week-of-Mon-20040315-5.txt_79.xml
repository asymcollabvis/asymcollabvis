  <content>Angered by the killing of a baby llama at the Salisbury 
Zoological Park, Del. Norman Conway, D-38-Wicomico, hopes to pass new legislation in 
Annapolis calling for stiffer penalties for crimes against animals. 
"I was able to introduce it late and we have a short time frame so we have to 
move quickly," he said. "I definitely believe that this is legislation that 
couldn't wait." 
Conway said House Bill 1546 was inspired by the Shannon Ray Hitchens case in 
which the 24-year-old Parsonsburg man allegedly broke into the zoo and fatally 
stabbed a 5-day-old llama. 
During his March 8 sentencing in Wicomico County Circuit Court, Hitchens 
accepted an Alford plea -- a guilty plea in which the defendant does not admit 
guilt but concedes that there is enough evidence to convict him -- to the charge 
of felony animal mutilation. The charge carries a maximum of three years in 
prison. 
Judge Kathleen Beckstead suspended all but 18 months of the three-year 
sentence and gave Hitchens credit for the six months he had already served in jail, 
leaving him with less than a year remaining. 
"He got a year, but with good behavior he could be out in six months," 
Detective Schejn Oliphant, the Salisbury police officer who investigated the case, 
said after the trial. "If he gets work release he could be out in time for 
summer." 
If passed, HB 1546 will increase the penalty for aggravated cruelty to 
animals from three years in jail and a $5,000 fine to six years imprisonment and a 
$10,000 fine. 
The last day of the General Assembly session is April 12. 
Conway said Thursday that HB 1546 passed the House of Delegates with 138 of 
141 votes and is headed to 
BILL, from Page A1 
the Rules Committee, then the Judiciary Committee before it goes to the 
Senate. </content>
