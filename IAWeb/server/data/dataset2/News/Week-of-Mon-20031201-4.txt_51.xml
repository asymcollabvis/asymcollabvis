All Woodcreek High boys basketball coach Paul Hayes and his Timberwolves did 
last season was take the community on one of the most exciting, drama-filled 
rides in this area has ever witnessed. 

For everyone involved, including then sports editor Jeffrey Weidel and 
myself, it was a wild and crazy ride that finally ended with a 70-49 loss to 
national power Mater Dei of Santa Ana.

Along the way the Timberwolves piled up an unprecedented list of firsts, 
beginning with the school?s first Sierra Foothill League title and followed by 
their initial trip to Arco Arena, where they preceded to knock off top-seeded 
Sacramento 63-49 for the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II title, another first.

Oakmont?s 1994 run to the state title game was the only other time a 
Roseville-area school had gone as far as high school basketball?s final stop. 

While their ever-growing contingent of ?Super Fans? continued to be 
pleasantly surprised by their antics, Woodcreek players were anything but surprised, 
and felt about as respected as Rodney Dangerfield. </content>
