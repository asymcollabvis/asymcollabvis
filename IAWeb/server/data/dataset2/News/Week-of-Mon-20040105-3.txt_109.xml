Regarding the story about the cat being dragged by the cable workers: This 
was an egregious act that, whether deliberate or not, should never have 
occurred. My main concern is that the true perpetrators of this vile criminal offense 
be punished.

I am also writing to state that I personally know the owner of the cable 
company on a business and community level. I have seen this man every week for a 
number of years at my place of work and can say nothing but nice things about 
him. He is a loving father of a large family, a professional and a good person 
all around.

I think it is wrong that this man's business and the livelihood of him and 
the other employees in his company should be put in jeopardy by the acts of a 
few, be they the workers or some other sick practical joker. The news and radio 
coverage I have seen just do not seem to answer all the questions posed in a 
case like this.

People have been calling his business and saying vile, cruel things about 
him, his company and his employees. This is almost as evil as what was done to 
the poor, innocent cat. 

If we as a community can have compassion for an animal, let us also try to 
remember that the acts of a few are isolated, but are not a true reflection of 
the whole.</content>
