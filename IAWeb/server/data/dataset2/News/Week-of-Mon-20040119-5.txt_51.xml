High atop a snow-swept plateau on the Crow Reservation, bison shuffled in the 
morning sun at the sound of an approaching airplane. 
As it passed overhead, most of the shaggy giants raced to the south, while a 
few others scattered here and there. They ran for a few seconds and, as the 
plane buzzed away, regrouped on a bare patch of ground that overlooks Bighorn 
Lake, craggy canyon walls and a wild landscape that stretches to every horizon. 
On this day, the sightseers' plane was a minor disturbance for the Crow bison 
that roam 22,000 acres on the reservation. 
The rest of the winter hasn't been so easy for them - or for the people 
trying to manage them. 
Recent drought and a growing herd have pinched the food supply and sent 
hundreds of buffalo spilling off the reservation onto private and public land in 
Wyoming. 
With ranchers and government officials worried about bison feeding on cattle 
grazing allotments, Crow Agency crews this fall and winter have been busy 
trying to push the bison back onto the reservation and keep them there. Because of 
the steep terrain and deep snow, much of the work has been done in 
helicopters and aboard snowmobiles, trucks and ATVs. 
"It's been pretty hectic," said Leroy Stewart, director of the buffalo 
program at Crow Agency. 
Three people on bison crews have been injured, none seriously, including one 
man who was in a pickup truck when it rolled at the bottom of a canyon and 
another who crashed an ATV.
