Some of those proclaiming the demise of canis lupis in the eastern slopes of 
the Rockies are crying wolf. 

That's according to some area hunters and trappers, such as Debbie and Ken 
Schroderus, who snare wolves and other animals on a line west of Rocky Mountain 
House. 

"They have an idea in their heads about how many wolves there are out there, 
but there are more than they realize," says Debbie Schroderus of Leslieville, 
150 km northwest of Calgary. 

Schroderus rejects any suggestion her and husband Ken's trapping activities 
have a hand in decimating the wolf population. 

The northwest corner of their trapline touches the boundary of Banff National 
Park -- one of the areas conservationists fear have become a killing ground 
for mountain park wolf packs. 

"To think we're actually doing any damage in the west country is not true ... 
we're barely putting a dent in the wolf numbers," says Schroderus, 45. 

If anything, the couple is acutely sensitive to the ecological state of the 
Crown land they frequent and their trapping helps maintain the predator-prey 
balance, she says. 

"We do love the animals and we're not out to slaughter the entire 
population," she says. "When you control the wolves you have a larger population of elk, 
deer and moose." </content>
