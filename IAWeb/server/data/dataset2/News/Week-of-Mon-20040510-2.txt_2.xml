The RSPCA today called for six soldiers who tortured and killed four
kittens at a barracks in Townsville to be dismissed from the Army.

RSPCA national president Hugh Wirth said the animal protection body had
been inundated with calls from members and the public expressing outrage
at the callous treatment of the kittens.

The Melbourne veterinarian wrote to Defence Minister Robert Hill today,
calling on him to make strong representations to army command to have the
six soldiers discharged because they were unfit to serve.

Dr Wirth said studies had shown that young people who tortured and killed
animals were prone to later acts of violence against other people
including wife bashing and other crimes.

"For that reason we believe there's no place for these people in the
army," Dr Wirth said.
