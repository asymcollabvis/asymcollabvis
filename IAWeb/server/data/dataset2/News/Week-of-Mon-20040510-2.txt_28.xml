UPPERVILLE, Va. --  At the Hunter's Head Tavern, "guilt-free dining" has
nothing to do with calories or carb counts.

The English pub in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, about 50
miles west of Washington, D.C., this week became the first restaurant in
the nation to receive an animal-welfare group's certification for a menu
with humanely raised and slaughtered fare, from the beef stew to the
shepherd's pie. 
...
"You can raise humane veal. There's no reason you have to keep them in a
crate, ... keep them anemic. God didn't create veal crates. We did,"
Lerner said. "If we can make people feel good about veal again, that's a
good thing."

A vegetarian for much of her life, Lerner said she understands the
contention by some that killing an animal for food is inhumane, no matter
how well you treat the animal in life or how painless the method of
slaughter is.

"People are going to eat meat," she said. "But if I get you to eat one of
my humanely raised turkeys, then that's one that Butterball doesn't kill."

Humane Farm Animal Care, which runs the certification program, is aligned
with two of the nation's leading animal-welfare organizations--the Humane
Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals.

HFAC is not affiliated with the animal-rights group People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, but PETA has been urging Kentucky Fried Chicken to
adopt HFAC's standards for the chicken served in its restaurants.
