As homes are built higher and higher on the bench areas along the Front and 
elsewhere in Utah, the natural living environment of such animals as moose, 
deer and mountain lions is compromised. They were here first, and, yes, the 
foothills are part of their natural habitat. They tend to spend summers higher in 
the mountains and move to lower elevations in winter where feed is more 
abundant. 
    At least, that's the way their normal migration habits were before 
asphalt, concrete, houses and all things human covered the terrain. Now what forage 
is found by moose or deer when they are adventurous enough -- or hungry enough 
-- often consists of the ornamental bushes and trees in the yards of the 
interlopers who have moved in on their territory. 
    The cow moose was tranquilized and removed to higher ground after 
homeowners called the state Division of Wildlife Resources. An aged and emaciated 
mountain lion that killed a dog near Holladay Boulevard on Saturday was 
tranquilized and eventually put down after it was determined she was unhealthy and 
probably would not live much longer. Two deer that were injured during a foray 
into the east benches of Davis County last week also had to be euthanized. 
The same is happening elsewhere. In California, a mountain biker was killed 
and another badly mauled by a mountain lion last week. </content>
