Something is rotten in the tropical fish import business and not just some dead
fish.

A southern environmentalist has succeeded in trapping poachers by conducting sting 
operations in Brazil - and Darla Banks loves doing this. 

She carries a concealed camera in her handbag and secretly films illegal 
freshwater fish collections, including the rare Black arwana and Cruz' Dwarf 
Pearlfish.

As a wildlife detective, Banks, 32, often bluffs her way into trafficking networks, 
claiming to run Internet distribution sites or a provider of counterfeit certifications. 

"When I'm on an investigation and dealing with poachers then I am 
sometimes treated differently," Banks, who is from Alabama, told the Daily Record.

Yet animal trafficking has a more sinister side to it. The illegal trade in wild animals 
is linked to other types of illegal activities such as drugs. In South America, drug
cartels, which make use of the fauna to transport their products,
are deeply involved with the illegal wildlife trade. Drugs are frequently
found within live animals or are hidden in their skins. In 1998,cocaine bags
were found within the stomachs of some boas seized in Rio de Janeiro.

Banks has been involved in undercover operations to expose the 
illegal trade in endangered tropical fish. Fish are in demand from people 
wanting trophies to display, while drug traffickers use yet another channel to
supply the US. "I step lightly around cartel activity," notes Banks.
