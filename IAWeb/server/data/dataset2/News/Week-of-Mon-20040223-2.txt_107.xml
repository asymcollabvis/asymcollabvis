WE love happy endings. Dogs and cats traversing thousands of miles to reunite 
with their humans is a Hollywood theme, but most "lost dog/cat" stories do 
not end happily. Losing a dog or cat is easier than you think, but simple 
precautions increase the odds of finding your lost pet. 
Make sure your dog or cat always wears a collar with identification tags even 
if it has been microchipped or tattooed. Anyone finding your lost pet would 
have your contact information at their fingertips. 
Rabies and license tags are registered with your contact information, and you 
can purchase identification tags with your name and contact phone numbers at 
almost any pet supply store, veterinarian office or off the Internet. Just 
remember, it is important to keep your contact information current. 
Collars with identification tags are important, but they easily can become 
separated from your dog or cat. Microchipping is a relatively inexpensive and 
virtually painless way to ensure that your dog or cat will be reunited with you 
if they ever become lost. Most veterinarians and shelters offer this service, 
and your pet is then registered in a nationwide database. 
Again, keep your contact information current.</content>
