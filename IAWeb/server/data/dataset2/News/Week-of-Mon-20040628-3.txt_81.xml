Don't worry. The live elephants stayed at home Saturday.

Still, enough pachyderms paraded to Ella Sharp Park to please those who
wanted to celebrate Jackson's 175th birthday and the Republican Party's
150th anniversary. 
...
While more than 1,300 protesters flooded the Greater Jackson Chamber of
Commerce to complain that live elephants shouldn't march in the parade,
far fewer than that took part in the parade and picnic.

"I think it's neat. It's too bad more people aren't aware of what's
going on," said Price, who painted an elephant sculpture that will be
displayed downtown this summer. "People always complain there's nothing
going on, but then they don't go to things like this." 
...
The elephant was chosen as a theme because the animal is the Republican
Party's mascot. Many in Jackson say the city is the party's birthplace
because of a July 6, 1854, convention where the first Republican
candidates and platform were chosen.
...
Meanwhile, no elephants marched in Saturday's parade. That prospect,
which parade organizers had floated months ago, galvanized the group
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Animal-rights activists hammered the chamber of commerce -- which is
backing the Founding Festival -- with pleas to reconsider. Parade
organizers did, although more because of difficulties in finding live
animals to march.
