Federal agents are demanding DNA swabs and palm prints from an activist
Detroit couple in connection with an attempted bombing at a west Michigan
water bottling plant.

Marie Mason and her husband, Frank Ambrose, say they're targets of a
federal campaign of intimidation designed to shut up loudmouthed
environmental protesters in Michigan. They will ask a judge to throw out
subpoenas for the palm prints and DNA that FBI agents surprised them with
on Oct. 27.

The radical group Earth Liberation Front immediately took credit for the
bomb. ELF is a shadowy, loose-knit group that has engaged in a stepped-up
campaign of sabotage and arson over the last several years, targeting
symbols of environmentalists' ire, including gas-guzzling Hummer SUVs and
new subdivisions in formerly rural areas.
...
In an e-mail to an environmental Internet discussion group after the
bombing, Massasauga Earth First! members wrote that the group "applauds
the Earth Liberation Front's attempt to damage Ice Mountain's pumping
station," but said Earth First! had no knowledge of or role in the crime.
