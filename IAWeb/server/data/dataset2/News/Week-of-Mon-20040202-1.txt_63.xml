Stanford, a 16-pound shorthaired orange tabby, can't get enough food into his 
belly. 
"His Buddha belly is never full enough," said Manager Ann Marie Biegner 
describing Stanford's insatiable appetite. "He's kind of a character."
She described him as a "big old boy" who can be a bit of a grump if he 
doesn't get his way. 
His coat ranges in shades from a marmalade orange to a rust color. It's shiny 
and well kept even though he was found roaming around near South Road last 
week. 
Beigner couldn't tell if he had been abandoned or if he had been in a 
household that wasn't to his liking. 
She suspected that a new cat might have been brought into Stanford's home and 
he decided to find a new place where he could be "king of the roost."
Like most cats he would like his new family to make a fuss over him when he 
asks and to let him lounge at his leisure.
Stanford "likes to voice his opinion" to let everyone know exactly what he 
wants, especially when it's to fill an empty dish.
She says he should be good with people, but he may have a hard time adjusting 
to other animals. 
He is neutered and is negative for feline leukemia and AIDS.
Like Stanford, Squeeky, a 2- year-old brown tabby with a white chest and 
white paws, likes to eat.
Squeeky is less demanding than her friend Stanford, and was brought to the 
rescue league after her owner had to move to housing for the elderly and 
couldn't take Squeeky with her. 
Squeeky had just arrived at the pound last Wednesday so she was still getting 
used to her surroundings. She is an indoor cat who is good with everybody: 
people, cats, and dogs.</content>
