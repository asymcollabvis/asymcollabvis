Second monkeypox outbreak hits US
 
 
Pet chinchilla may be carriers 

Seven people in the Los Angeles area have seriously ill from monkeypox - a rare smallpox-like disease, US health officials say. More than 50 possible cases are being investigated. 

Health authorities believe the source of the infection was a chinchilla, which has not previously known to be susceptible to the virus. Pet shops, distributors, and breeder farms are being investigated.

A concern is that the virus could spread to other rodents - especially wild mice and rabbits - and become uncontrollable if established in native species, the CDC says.
