It's almost inevitable. In even the most carefully chosen food plan, there
comes that time when your diet is no longer working. Either the weight is
returning or you're just plain bored because you find yourself eating the
same foods day after day. Every diet has inherent pitfalls. If you're in a
rut, the first thing you need to do is identify the obstacle and then find
your way around it. Here are some ways to successfully navigate the
landmines of the most popular weight-management methods:

Vegetarian

Physicians, nutritionists and every food study ever done recommend a diet
high in fruits and vegetables. The vegetarian is one of the few who meets
or exceeds these recommendations, and is the darling of the diet world.
What could possibly be wrong?

Advantages: A plethora of healthful, low-calorie foods is available. If
the emphasis is on fruits and vegetables, you can nearly eat your fill
without worrying about calories, Richter said. The diet is also steeped in
vitamins and nutrients.

Pitfalls: Animal protein contains its share of vital nutrients, including
vitamin B-12 and beta carotene, Thompson said. And since cupcakes fit a
vegetarian diet as well as carrots, some people think a dinner of broccoli
and soy allows them to splurge on cheesecake and milkshakes (or, if their
diet prohibits dairy products, fries and onion rings). A strict vegetarian
diet can also be strictly boring.

The fix: Be creative to eliminate the boredom. There are dozens of
vegetarian cookbooks filled with meals and desserts that challenge the
taste buds, Thompson said. Add legumes for protein and avoid overloading
on carbohydrates by eating whole grains, Richter said.
