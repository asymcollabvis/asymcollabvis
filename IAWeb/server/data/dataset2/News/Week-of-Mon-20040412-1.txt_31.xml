  <content> Consider the pig. The animal's intelligence and cleanliness are
often ? wrongfully ? maligned. And most people think it makes a better
pork roast than pet.

Judy Woods considers the pig. She considers its well-being and health, and
she worries that fate is seldom kind to the barnyard mainstay.

She also considers pigs friends.

Woods runs the 34-acre Pigs Peace Sanctuary, the only such sanctuary in
the state. There's one other pig sanctuary in West Virginia and maybe less
than a half-dozen in the nation, by her estimation.

Woods calls the 90 or so pigs at the sanctuary by name. They walk up to
her, and she scratches their ears.

Such enlightenment is a key part of the sanctuary theme. There's an
education center, where visitors are taught about pigs, vegetarianism and
facets of animal existence.</content>
