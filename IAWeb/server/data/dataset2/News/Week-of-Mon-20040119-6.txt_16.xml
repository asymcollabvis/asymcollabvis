I was told that there was egg in the popcorn. Imagine that!

After I regurgitated the few grains I hungrily consumed earlier, I read
the ingredients off the microwaveable bag. Egg powder.

Next thing I'll hear is that they'll be using souse to make ice cream.

I stopped eating meat, fish and eggs many years ago whilst awaiting the
results of my first University of London examinations. I had hoped that my
sacrifice would appease the Gods and success would be granted. 
...
The weird thing about it is, when a place actually caters for vegetarians,
the "carnivores" will eat all the salads and veggie delights first then
look at the meat trays. Case in point: when vegetarian and meat topping
pizzas are ordered at the office, which of the slices go first? There's
already so little out there for a true vegan to eat, why deprive us of the
few lettuce leaves on the table?

It's been a while since I've decided not to eat anything that once had a
face or could scream in terror when it was cut and I don't miss the taste
of meat at all for those reasons. 
...
So this year I'm planning to walk with my own little bag of goodies-maybe
a few extra biscuits stuffed into my pocket for good measure-whenever I
have to go somewhere where a vegetarian is as uncommon as an honest
politician.

At least when the meat eaters have run out of options, I'll still be
happily fed.</content>
