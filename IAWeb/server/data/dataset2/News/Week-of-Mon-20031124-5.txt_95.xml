When one deer hunter shoots another, the knee-jerk reaction is often one that 
questions the victim's negligence. 
That disturbs Steve Adcock, the hunter education/safety coordinator for the 
Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. 
"At least 95 percent of the time, when I'm telling somebody about a two-party 
deer hunting accident, the first question I get is 'Was the victim wearing 
orange?' " Adcock said. "I never have understood that. 
"Sure, wearing orange is an important part of hunting safety, and it is the 
law. But the sentence for not wearing orange is certainly not to be shot." 
The emphasis should be on the shooter's mistake, Adcock said. 
"The bottom line is that when you point your gun at something and pull the 
trigger, you are responsible for that bullet," he said. "You need to be aware of 
that. You need to be sure of what you are shooting at. You need be sure of 
what's beyond it." 
No doubt, the 1973 law that first required deer hunters to wear identifying 
orange clothing has had a great impact on hunting safety in Mississippi. 
In 1972, there were 80 total accidents that included 34 deaths. The state 
Legislature took immediate action and required either an orange cap or vest. In 
1973, there were still 76 total accidents but fatalities were reduced to 16, 
and accident rates continued to drop. Between 1973 and 1988, when the law was 
changed to require the current minimum of 500 square inches of orange, only five 
years produced 10 or more fatalities.</content>
