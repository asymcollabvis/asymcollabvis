The cameras are rolling at Purdue University's
animal research center, tracking a half-dozen pigs, each with an ink
streak slathered across its back for identification.

The pigs have a choice to make. They can use their snouts either to
let them into a pen where they can socialize with other pigs, or to
gain entry to another pen with more food.

``We want to get the animal's perspective, to see what they prefer,''
explains Edmond A. Pajor, the assistant professor of animal behavior
and welfare who heads the Purdue center. ``We want to know: How
important is social contact and space? What do they like and need?''
...
McDonald's, Burger King, KFC and Wendy's all have underwritten
research and recently hired what are called ``animal welfare
specialists'' to help them devise new standards aimed at ensuring
more humane treatment of the animals destined for their kitchens.
Industry trade groups are promoting the new rules and conducting
audits of livestock producers to assure they are being followed,
though some groups express concern about higher costs and other
complications.
...
The changes are being applauded even by PETA (People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals), an organization best known for guerrilla
attacks on the fur industry and fast-food outlets, and for
publicizing photographs of what they say are cruel acts being
performed on farm animals.

``McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's have done some pretty good
stuff, but they had to be prodded into it,''' said Dan Shannon, a
spokesman for PETA. ``These animals are not living in luxury suites
being hand-fed grapes, but this is an improvement.''
