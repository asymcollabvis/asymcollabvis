THE New Jersey black bear hunt scheduled for December is in jeopardy, and if 
what we are hearing is accurate, it looks as if Gov. McGreevey will buckle 
under to pressure from the so-called animal rights groups. 
"The McGreevey administration has time and again displayed its sympathy for 
the anti-hunting cause," said Rob Sexton, U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance Vice 
President for Government Affairs. Sexton explained that all signs point to McGreevey 
siding with anti-hunting activists against wildlife experts, public safety 
concerns and hunters. 
"The governor has created committees to establish wildlife policy and stacked 
them with animal rights advocates," he said. 
McGreevey's Dept. of Environmental Protection commissioner, Bradley Campbell, 
has in recent weeks gone so far as to blame homeowners for incidents with 
nuisance black bears. Campbell has admitted to wanting to take a serious look at 
birth control for the animals, as a means of controlling wildlife populations, 
in order to discourage hunting. 
The N.J. Fish and Game Council approved the black bear hunt in July to 
address concerns about the state's uncontrolled black bear population and the 
problems, including human conflicts with bears, which result from it. The conflicts 
include an incident in May in which a New Jersey toddler was struck on the 
head by a 175-pound female bear. In August, an 18-year-old woman survived a bear 
attack at a park near her home. 
 
Those in favor of the hunt should contact Gov. McGreevey at (609) 292-6000 
and urge him to protect public safety and sportsmen's rights. Ask him to allow 
the black bear hunt to continue as scheduled Dec. 8-13. 
Anti-hunters also filed a lawsuit this week against the N.J. DEP to suspend 
all hunting, fishing and trapping. </content>
