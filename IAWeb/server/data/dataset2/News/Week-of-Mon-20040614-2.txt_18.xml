A KANGAROO stopped traffic yesterday when he wandered off the beaten track 
and into a Port Macquarie shop.

The big male Eastern grey was discovered in the store room at ColorTile at 
lunchtime yesterday.

Employee Janette Collins said she didn't believe it when two tourists 
wandering past stopped to ask if she knew about the roo.

"I thought they were joking and said 'yeah that happens all the time'.

"Then I looked over and there it was," she said.

"We had to stop deliveries for about two hours because we didn't want it to 
get out and be hurt in traffic."

But then staff faced the dilemma of how to move the animal.

The RSPCA was called, then WIRES and finally the National Parks and Wildlife 
Service.
