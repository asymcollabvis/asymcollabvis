  <content>In the next nine months politics, political candidates 
and special-interest campaigns will bombard us from all directions. We will be 
hammered with truths, half-truths and outright lies. As voters, we will have 
to sift through the rhetoric and try to make sense of what we read, what we 
hear and what we see on television.  
The upcoming bear referendum - seeking a ban on hunting bear over bait, 
hunting with dogs and trapping bear - is an issue that will definitely be 
sensationalized, probably by both sides. 
The referendum petitions that were dropped off at the secretary of state's 
office recently had hardly landed when licensed hunters and anglers across the 
state began receiving mail from a group called Maine Citizens for Fair Bear 
Hunting. Although the name sounds innocuous enough, the group's major financial 
supporters and many of those involved in the campaign want to ban all hunting. 
Some even want to end sport fishing. 
Three men claiming to be a master Maine guide, a retired Maine guide and bear 
hunter, and a lifelong hunter signed the letter, asking for donations and 
support from other hunters and anglers. 
These three claimed they are "not members of any animal rights group." This 
may be true, but the major financial sponsors of this measure that would ban 
hunting bears over bait and with dogs is financially supported by the Humane 
Society of the United States and Fund for Animals, two groups that want to see an 
end to all hunting. The bear referendum is a single issue, designed to 
fracture the outdoor community and help achieve their long-term goal of ending all 
hunting.
