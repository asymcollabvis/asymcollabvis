The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to
notify industry officials of positive mad cow test results at least one
hour before informing the public, according to a meat industry
newsletter obtained by United Press International.

The revelation comes as government officials are being investigated for
possibly leaking information about the first U.S. case of mad cow in
December to commodity traders prior to telling the public.

The USDA launched an expanded surveillance program June 1 in response to
the December case that involves initially screening cows with a rapid
test. Those tests can yield false positives, so they are being
categorized as inconclusive until confirmed by additional tests.
