Shooting wolves from airplanes as a form of predator control could resume 
early next year if the Alaska Board of Game takes advantage of a new state law at 
its meeting in Anchorage this week. 
It would be the first aerial wolf control in nearly 20 years and is certain 
to stir emotions in Alaska and beyond. Wolf-protection advocates plan a 
demonstration airing their point of view at the Game Board at 10:30 a.m. today at the 
Millennium Alaskan Hotel, where the board is meeting. Organizers say they 
will bring "wolf look-alikes" dressed in bulletproof vests. 
National protests, including a tourism boycott, are also possible, said 
Dorothy Keeler, a wildlife photographer and longtime vocal opponent of wolf 
control. A boycott in the early 1990s helped persuade former Gov. Wally Hickel to 
call off the last planned lethal wolf-control program. 
But even as protesters speak out, Game Board members say they believe other 
Alaskans, particularly hunters and rural residents, are ready for lethal wolf 
control, which is aimed at boosting populations of game animals, to resume. 
The board could approve a long-awaited predator control program in a small 
area around McGrath. Also at the meeting, the board will consider similar 
measures for the Skwentna region and could lay the groundwork for programs elsewhere 
around the state.
