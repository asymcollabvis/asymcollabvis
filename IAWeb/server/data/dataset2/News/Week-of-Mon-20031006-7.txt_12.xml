  <content>The 10-year-old considers the question - How long have you
been a vegetarian? -and offers a thoughtful answer.

"About a year and a half," he says between bites of baby carrots. "What
really did it for me was I read the book, `Fast Food Nation,' and it
describes in there how the meat is killed. It's really gross."

Cindy Lawler, child nutrition director for Asheville City Schools, says
last year Dickson Elementary bought twice as much produce as another
comparably sized elementary school, Claxton Elementary. Dickson receives
more fresh fruit and vegetables than any other Asheville elementary school.

The vegetarian trend, or kids being interested in more vegetables and
fruits, continues to grow slowly systemwide, though.

"We have seen more and more vegetarian students," Lawler said. "I've been
here going on eight years now, and I would say there's been a gradual
increase every year. It's not a huge jump from year to year, but it is
growing."

It's difficult to put a specific number on vegetarians because the schools
don't serve "vegetarian meals" specifically. And a lot of kids opt to
bring their own lunch.

"If I'm forced to eat the school lunch I will, and if I do I take the
salad bar and don't eat meat," said Holden Beale, 10, a Dickson fifth-grader.
...
"It usually costs more than twice the amount for a school system to serve
a veggie burger than a meat hamburger," said Jennifer Keller, a registered
dietician and the author of the annual school lunch report put out by the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a Washington, D.C.,
nonprofit that promotes preventive medicine and a vegetarian diet.
