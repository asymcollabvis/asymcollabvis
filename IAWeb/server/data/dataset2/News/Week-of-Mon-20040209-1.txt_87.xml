A not-so-civil war has erupted at the Sierra Club, the country's oldest
and largest environmental group, and its leaders say that the heart and
soul of the venerable, San Francisco-based organization are at stake.

The fight centers on the club's policy on immigration. At issue is whether
the club should adopt a position of strict U.S. immigration controls as a
way to limit the environmental impact of overpopulation -- and risk
alienating many of the progressive groups that typically ally themselves
with the club.

The immigration issue has polarized club members before, but this time the
battle has taken on an epic quality, involving a host of other issues,
from animal rights to the club's own democratic traditions, and attracting
the involvement of an array of outside groups trying to influence the
club's policies. 
...
They note that many outside groups -- ranging from People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals to white supremacy organizations -- have waded into
the controversy, urging their members to join the club simply to cast
their votes for one slate or the other.
...
"If it wasn't so sad, it'd be comical," said Frank Morris, a board
candidate and retired college professor who lives in Texas. "I'm African
American. I'm a past president of an NAACP chapter, and I was executive
director of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation from 1983 to 1986.
And yet, they just hammer us with these absurd, ad hominen attacks."
