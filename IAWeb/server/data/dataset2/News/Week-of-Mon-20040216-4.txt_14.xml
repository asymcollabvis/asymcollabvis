People urged not to feed them 
Sure, living in the woods during a winter when there's been more than 71 
inches of snowfall can be uncomfortable. 
It can be tough. 
But it doesn't have to be fatal. 
Even though there's been continuous snow coverage on the ground since the 
first week of December - sometimes deep snow with an icy crust on the surface - 
Pennsylvania Game Commission personnel are not reporting significant 
winter-related mortality among the Commonwealth's wild animals and birds. 
"Wildlife are built to handle these types of winters. They are, for the most 
part, able to survive," said Jerry Feaser, the game commission's press 
secretary. 
Mel Schake, the game commission's information and education supervisor for 
southwestern Pennsylvania, said wildlife conservation officers in his region 
have found a couple of deer that apparently died of broken bones and other 
injuries sustained in falls on icy hillsides. And Indiana County's wildlife 
conservation officers reported that four deer died when they fell through the ice 
covering the Mahoning and Little Mahoning creeks. 
But game commission personnel are not seeing widespread evidence of animals 
and birds starving. 
"As tough as it seems, it's not negatively impacting wildlife," Schake said.</content>
