MONROVIA -- Some showed up dressed in black, their heads hidden by
balaclavas, death-head masks or faces half-covered with bandannas like
bandits. They were there to demonstrate for the first time since
Monrovia officials passed an ordinance requiring them to stay at least
300 feet from a targeted residence, in this case the Upton Sinclair
house, in the 400 block of North Myrtle Avenue, whose owner they allege
has ties to a firm that does scientific testing on animals.

"What we want to do is enlighten the neighborhood,' said David Rutan,
who described himself as a legal observer.

"To exercise our First Amendment rights and let people know of some of
the activities of one of their neighbors, Mitchell Lardner, and what he
is responsible for, the suffering of animals, the animal cruelty he is
responsible for,' Rutan said.

Demonstrators had protested three times since April 23 at Lardner's
home. Lardner works for Sumitomo Corp. of America, a company protesters
allege is linked to New Jersey-based Huntingdon Life Sciences, which
performs tests on animals.
