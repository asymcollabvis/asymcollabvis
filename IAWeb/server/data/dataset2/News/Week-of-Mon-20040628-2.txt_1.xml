BUNNELL -- With a check for $30,000, the Flagler County Humane Society
can close the books on an animal cruelty case that made national
headlines seven years ago.

West Flagler County residents Linda and Henry Brinkley were ordered to
pay $51,120 to reimburse the shelter for caring for hundreds of
mistreated dogs seized from their home in 1997. But Shelter Director Amy
Wade-Carotenuto said she's satisfied with the check received last week.
...
After being convicted in 1998 on 12 misdemeanor counts of animal
cruelty, the court ordered the Brinkleys to pay the Humane Society
$51,120 for expenses incurred taking care of 517 dogs seized from the
couple's home in unincorporated Flagler County. During the trial,
witnesses said many of the dogs from the Brinkleys' puppy mill ended up
for sale at a flea market.
