An animal-rights group sued the state Attorney General's Office
yesterday, accusing it of violating public records laws by refusing to
release some documents about the slaughter of cows at one of the state's
largest meatpacking plants.

In a lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court, the Humane Farming
Association alleged state officials withheld information from their
investigation into the association's complaint about the meatpacking
plant.

The organization, based in San Rafael, Calif., complained in 2000 that
cows were being strung up and processed alive at the IBP plant in
Wallula, now operated by Tyson Fresh Meats.
