  <content>Joseph Stuebing's trip to a local feed store in early 
October 2003 mattered little to state and local officials who visited his Dutch Mill 
Road farm that day -- looking for answers to explain why 23 horses in his 
care were slowly starving and dying. 
"I saw about seven vehicles pulling in at one time, like a parade," Stuebing 
told his attorney during a pre-trial hearing in municipal court Wednesday. "I 
was just bombarded with people ... and panicked. It was overwhelming. They 
were just bombarding me with questions." 

 
Stuebing claimed he did not know he had a right to refuse the officials 
entrance to his farm. Arguing a motion to suppress evidence against Stuebing, 
defense attorney Charles Iannuzzi said that the "entourage" of officials 
overwhelmed Stuebing that day, making him feel as if he had no choice in the matter but 
to allow them on the farm. 
"(The state) fails to tell him he has a right to refuse," Iannuzzi said. "As 
a result, the fruits of that search should be suppressed." 
Municipal prosecutor John Adams argued that Dr. Karen Froberg, a senior 
veterinarian for disease control with the State Department of Agriculture, has a 
right to enter any farm with or without the owner's permission for the safety of 
the public. </content>
