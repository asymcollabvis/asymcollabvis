Animal shelters never know what they're getting. They have to take the bad 
with the good, and sometimes the bad is heartbreaking. 
Employees at the Bootheel Humane Society in Sikeston arrived at work 
Wednesday morning, to a pathetic sight. A sick and suffering dog left overnight in an 
outside drop box. Shelter managers insist, it shows why we must all take 
action against animal abuse and neglect. "It's horrendous," says Gabby Evans. "It's 
absolutely horrendous that someone let an animal get into this shape!"
A9-month old male puppy has less than half its hair, t here's a line from it 
mouth, down it's sides, and under it's tail, and his bottom half has no 
hair.Yet it was dumped in an outside concrete kennel overnight in single-digit 
temperatures."This collar is actually causing more problems," explains Gabby. She's 
the director of the Bootheel Humane Society. "There are open wounds. This is 
chunks of meat and hair, just falling off this dog. He's in horrible pain."
Gabby calls this a severe case of neglect and cruelty. And Sikeston's Code 
Enforcement Officer agrees."They should have taken care of the dog long before 
it got this bad, or they should have destroyed the dog," says Tom Burns. "I 
just don't see how anyone can let an animal get in this kind of shape."
"I'm sorry, buddy," the veterinarian mumbles to the puppy as she examines 
him.Dr. Colleen Retz with the Animal Health Center responded immediately. The 
puppies may have sarcoptic mange, which can be transferred to humans."It's all 
infected under his skin," she explains.</content>
