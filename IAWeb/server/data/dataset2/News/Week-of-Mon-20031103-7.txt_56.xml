It might not get the publicity of the presidential primary or clog the
highways like leaf-peeping season, but Wednesday is one of the big days on
New Hampshire?s public-events calendar: the start of regular deer-hunting
season.

Nobody knows how many people will carry their rifles into New Hampshire?s
woods Wednesday, but the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service estimates there are
some 60,000 deer hunters in the state.
...
Last year, archers took 1,854 deer while muzzleloader hunters took 2,911,
almost half the 6,064 tally of regular firearm hunters.

Further, hunting is stagnant overall, partly because of growing
alternatives for recreation.

?In today?s world there are so many activities available to people that
hunting is competing with a lot of other things for people?s time,
attention and money,? Gustafson said. ?But certainly the interest and
passion is there, without a doubt.?
...
Finally, another question mark has been added to deer hunters? concerns:
chronic wasting disease.

This disease, similar to mad cow disease, has struck white-tailed deer in
the upper Midwest.

Chronic wasting disease has not been known to spread to humans, or any
animal but deer and elk, and has never been seen on the East Coast. Still,
officials are being cautious: New Hampshire officials banned the import of
deer and elk last year and will examine killed deer?s brains and spinal
tissue to make sure it has not arrived.

The state is not making any special recommendations to hunters as a result
of chronic wasting disease, but it is emphasizing suggestions that have
been made for years, such as wearing rubber gloves while cleaning the carcass.
