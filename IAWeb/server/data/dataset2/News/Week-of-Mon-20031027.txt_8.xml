Susan I. Jando, 64, has sheltered derelict felines at her home for 19 years. 
It began with just a few and then ... word spread. 
"I get them from all around," Jando said. "Everybody calls me. Nobody ever 
shows up with anything but cats." 
People bring cats from Midland, Saginaw and Flint. After a disease outbreak 
at the Humane Society of Tuscola County even that agency looked to unload extra 
cats on Jando. 
She has partnered with others to help rescue cats, calling her group the 
"Cass River Pet Friendz." 
She shelters 32 cats at her home. She had about 50 several months ago. 
Tuscola County no longer offers animal control facilities. A budget shortfall 
forced the elimination of the department and voters rejected a tax increase 
to finance the project. Animal control has not operated since 2002. Voters will 
again confront the issue Tuesday when they vote on a reallocation of 
millages. 
Mark A. Wachner of the Saginaw County Animal Care Center says that private 
animal rescue operations are helpful, but he advises rescuers to proceed with 
caution. 
"Good rescues are a real benefit," he said, "but it can get overwhelming. 
Animals are not designed to live in a cage."
