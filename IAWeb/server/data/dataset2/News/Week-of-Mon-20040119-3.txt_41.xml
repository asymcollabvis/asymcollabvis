The discovery of Mad Cow disease on a Washington farm has touched off a
firestorm about U.S. regulations to prevent this deadly disease. But Mad
Cow represents much deeper perils of a global industrial food system,
accelerated by recent trade agreements. It is Mad Cow making the headlines
today, but in the last year it has also been e coli, salmonella,
antibiotic resistance, foot and mouth disease, and obesity. The question
is whether we are going to address each crisis as it comes along in a
patchwork of regulations, or re-think our food and farming system?
...
Amid the roar of the industrial food system is a movement driven primarily
by consumers to re-connect with our food producers. Farmers markets have
grown nearly 80 percent over the last ten years. State-labeled food
products, such as ?Minnesota-Grown,? are seen more and more on supermarket
shelves. In November, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and
the Global Resource Action Center for the Environment (GRACE) launched a
simple Web site to help consumers find local farmers who produce
sustainable meat and poultry. To our surprise, the site
(www.eatwellguide.org) got over 8 million hits in the first month.
Hopefully, the discovery of Mad Cow disease in the United States ? the
product of an industrial, global food system ? will spawn a new discussion
about what kind of food system is best for farmers, consumers and our
rural communities. It?s about more than just one cow.</content>
