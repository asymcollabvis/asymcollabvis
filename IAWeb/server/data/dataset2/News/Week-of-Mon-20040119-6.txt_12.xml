  <content>In great ape terms, nine-month-old 
orangutan orphan CT could consider herself lucky. 
The furry orange ball's arrival at Malaysia's main orangutan centre last 
month, after a plantation owner tipped off staff about her fate, makes her future 
prospects quite bright. 
Her kin and other great ape species are not so fortunate. 
Sepilok has a strong record of rehabilitating its charges to the wild. It 
sits in Sabah state, the part of orangutan territory probably least likely to be 
destroyed. 
But orangutans elsewhere in Borneo and in Sumatra face a grave risk of 
extinction while their close African cousins gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos are 
in danger everywhere. 
Orangutans' main problems are forest fires, illegal logging and poaching of 
their babies to supply an illicit pet trade. 
Habitat loss threatens the other great apes across central and western 
Africa, which also face being killed for their meat. 
Adopted as "flagship species" by conservationists, along with animals such as 
rhinos and giant pandas, great apes have assumed the role of high-level 
envoys in extinction diplomacy. 
For orangutans, that means symbolising efforts to protect Southeast Asia's 
rainforests and other habitats, according to Geoffrey Davison, WWF Malaysia's 
Borneo Programme Director. 
"If orangutans are conserved, then other wildlife will be saved alongside 
them," he says. 
Such issues feature high on the agenda for a meeting from February 9 to 20 in 
Kuala Lumpur where government officials from around the world will discuss 
how to slow global species loss. 
Beefing up protected areas is one of the priorities of the United Nations 
Convention on Biological Diversity, the broad aim of which is to achieve a 
"significant" drop in the rate of species extinctions by 2010. </content>
