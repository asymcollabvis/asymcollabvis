Perched motionless on a rock across the street from the 
Paiute Tribal Headquarters in Cedar City, a Utah prairie dog late last month 
spied on officials arriving to discuss whether the threatened species is 
compatible with golfers. 
    The problem lies in the prairie dogs' penchant for panoramic views and 
need for ample water and food -- habitat provided by the well-groomed fairways 
and greens of the Cedar City-owned Ridgeway Golf Course, located adjacent to 
tribal land. 
    "The golf course is a 'Mazatlan' for prairie dogs," says Rick Holman, the 
city's adminis- trative-services director. "In spring and summer, they just 
lie down, stretched out on their bellies, eating the grass." 
    While still short of the colossal problem caused by the burrowing gopher 
menace portrayed in the 1980 movie "Caddyshack," a matrix of tunnels dug 
beneath the golf course by the burrowing prairie dogs is creating maintenance 
problems and safety concerns.
