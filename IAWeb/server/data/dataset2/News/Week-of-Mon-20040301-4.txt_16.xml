Newswise ? When 15 students in a brand-new Mississippi State University 
academic course shoulder their backpacks and head to class, textbooks aren?t their 
major concern. 
In addition to their normal note-taking tools, they?re packing fingerprint 
powder, evidence markers and cotton swabs. 
The students are a new breed of forensic scientists?those learning to 
investigate crimes against wildlife and the great outdoors. In a class being taught 
at MSU for the first time this semester by the husband-wife team of Richard 
Minnis and Clare Chesnavage, the future forensic scientists are getting hands-on 
training in tracking crimes ranging from hunting out of season to importing 
restricted animals. 
The teaching duo is making academic history with their effort. ?Mississippi 
State is the only university in North America offering a course in wildlife 
forensics and one of a few universities offering a degree in wildlife law 
enforcement,? Minnis noted. 
To develop the course, Minnis did his homework. The assistant research 
professor in the College of Forest Resources, also a deputy for the Oktibbeha County 
sheriff?s office, interviewed several forensic laboratories around the United 
States. He received assistance from Chesnagave, who has worked for the Naval 
Criminal Investigative Service on cold cases and as a medical technologist in 
laboratories for more than 15 years. 
?Wildlife crime scenes are outdoors and cover an extremely large area, unlike 
most traditional crime scenes, which are indoors and very small,? Minnis 
explained. ?In this course, we have to be innovative and alter the techniques used 
in traditional forensics to adapt them for wildlife.? </content>
