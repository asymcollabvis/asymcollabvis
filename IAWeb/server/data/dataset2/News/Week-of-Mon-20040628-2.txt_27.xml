Imagine what those animal welfare people would say if a band of  hunters 
strung a mile of net between two vast all-terrain vehicles and dragged  it across 
the plains of Africa. This fantastical assemblage, like something from  a Mad 
Max movie, would scoop up everything in its way: lions, cheetahs,  elephants, 
rhinos, impala, wildebeest and wild dogs. Only the smallest juveniles  would 
be able to wriggle through the mesh. 
The effect of dragging a net with an iron bar across its mouth  across the 
plains is to break off every outcrop and uproot every bush, stirring  columns of 
birds into the air. Left behind is a landscape like a harrowed field.  The 
industrial hunter-gatherers stop to examine the tangled mess of writhing or  
dead creatures behind them. Some are too small, too mangled, or the wrong  
species. These are dumped on the plain to be consumed by carrion.
This efficient but unselective way of killing animals is called  trawling. It 
is practised the world over each day, from the Barents Sea to the  shores of 
Antarctica, and from the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean to Cape  Cod. 
Yet, because what fishermen do is obscured by a veil of water and  because 
fish are cold-blooded rather than cuddly, most people think of what  happens at 
sea differently from what happens on land.
