A greyhound, with a hole in its head and both ears missing, was found dumped 
alive on a mountainside, it emerged today.

The RSPCA branded the incident ?barbaric? and said the ?deeply distressed? 
animal may have been a racing dog, which would have had tattooed ears to 
identify it.

The black and white greyhound was found by a member of the public who was 
walking a pet on a mountainside between Fochriw and Bargoed n the Rhymney Valley, 
south Wales, last Sunday. It was taken to a vet by a dog warden and put down.

RSPCA inspector Simon Evans said: ?This is a shocking, horrific incident; the 
greyhound had suffered immensely. He was put to sleep after experiencing 
unimaginable pain and distress.

?Whoever carried out this barbaric act may have thought the dog was already 
dead when they dumped him. I believe the culprit chose the location very 
carefully, hoping the greyhound would never be found.
