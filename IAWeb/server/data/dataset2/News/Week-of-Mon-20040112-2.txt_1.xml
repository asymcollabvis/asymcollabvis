Tribune reader Michael Welch recently took the paper to task for running a
story about the Democratic presidential hopefuls that, in his words,
"presented mostly facile tidbits about personal lives and individual
style, while barely exploring candidates' positions on substantive issues."

Welch also complained the story focused on U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich's
vegan diet while ignoring his position in support of a Canadian-style,
single-payer health care system.

Simmer down, Mr. Welch. I promise you that before the Wisconsin primary
Feb. 17, the Tribune will publish many substantive issue-oriented stories
about the candidates.

I also want to pick a bone with Mr. Welch for his statement that "anyone
voting for or against a candidate based upon dietary preferences would
obviously be a fool!"

You wouldn't want to judge every candidate based solely on his or her
eating habits. But in some cases, diet might say more about a politician
than a Big Mac-high stack of position papers.

Kucinich's vegan diet ? which means he doesn't eat animal products,
including milk and eggs ? says a great deal about the candidate, his world
view and his commitment to the environment. Not all voters might agree
with those views, but nobody can argue that Kucinich doesn't live ? and
eat ? his values. How many politicians can you say that about these days?
