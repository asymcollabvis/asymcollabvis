To Sabino Canyon-area residents who fear mountain lions roaming through their 
neighborhood, Rodney Coronado carried a simple message Friday, two days after 
his arrest on charges of disrupting a state-sanctioned lion hunt. 
"I'd say, move Downtown if you can't live peacefully with animals who have 
been here thousands of years," said Coronado, an Earth First activist who is 
charged with trespassing and entering a closed facility. "It's time for you to 
relocate, not the lions." 
He said he did not think his activities had increased the chances of a 
lion-human encounter: "I think the actions of developers and the Game and Fish 
Department will do more to destabilize lions than anything I did." And if he had 
had an encounter with a mountain lion and scaring it with shouts or stones 
hadn't worked, he would never have shot the cat even if he had had a gun - which he 
said he didn't. 
"I'm going to fight to defend myself, but if it's my time to go, it's my time 
to go," said Coronado, 37, who is part Yaqui and part Mexican-American. He 
was released from custody Thursday on his own recognizance, one day after he and 
a writer for Esquire magazine were charged with trespassing and interfering 
with the lion hunt. 
"I'd rather die in a lion attack than in a car accident, that's for sure," he 
said. "There's more dignity and honor dying in the wilderness as part of the 
food chain rather than in rush hour on Speedway." 
But while Coronado proclaimed his 10 hours of disruption a success, four 
Sabino Canyon-area residents disagreed. </content>
