  <content>Indigenous people from around the world demanded at 
a conference Wednesday that governments respect aboriginal land ownership and 
halt development and resettlement programs that can harm the environment.

Hundreds of thousands of indigenous people have been displaced from their 
territories, often by modernization programs that don't adequately compensate 
them, activists said on the sidelines of a U.N.-backed biodiversity conference.

"Atrocities against indigenous people across the world are incredible," said 
Canadian activist Fred Fortier of the International Indigenous Forum on 
Biodiversity.

Indigenous groups urged governments at the conference to enforce policies 
that give communities the right to reject development projects, Fortier said. 
They also want the right to fight involuntary resettlement and reject any 
unilateral creation of protected areas or commercial exploitation of their natural 
resources, Fortier said.

He was speaking at the nearly two-week Seventh Conference of the Parties to 
the Convention on Biological Diversity, which started Monday in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia. More than 2,000 government delegates, scientists, and 
environmentalists at the conference will discuss a plan to help indigenous people share 
wealth created by their resources.

But some activists said this misses the point that aboriginal communities 
often place their cultural and spiritual values above financial reward.

"We are linked to our land," said Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of 
Congo's Mbuti pygmies. "We must not be ordered to leave for money or material 
compensation. That is not what we're seeking."</content>
