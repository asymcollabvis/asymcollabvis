  <content>From a $50 million arson at a San Diego condominium to four 
chickens liberated from a California egg farm, radical environmental groups 
had a busy year - but with a difference. 
While the Pacific Northwest was their focus for years, they now seem to have 
virtually abandoned the region, spreading their violent political action 
through the rest of the country, according to a list of actions released Wednesday 
by the groups. 
The FBI considers the two largest groups, the Animal Liberation Front and the 
Earth Liberation Front, to be terrorist organizations. 
"All I can tell you is that they are moving out around the country," said 
Paul Bresson, an FBI spokesman in Washington, D.C. 
In an e-mail sent to news media, the radical groups listed actions from Maine 
to California and from Louisiana to Alaska. 
The groups claimed responsibility for 75 actions in 2003. Only one - 10,000 
mink freed from a fur farm in Sultan, Wash., by the Animal Liberation Front - 
was in the Pacific Northwest. No ELF actions were near the Northwest forests 
where the group had flourished since it was founded. Until last year the fronts 
struck often against logging operations, Forest Service facilities, fur farms, 
slaughterhouses and other targets in the region.</content>
