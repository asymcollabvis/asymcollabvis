In an unusual verdict in favor of city police, a jury has rejected a
lawsuit claiming that city cops used unreasonable force during an anti-fur
protest at Neiman Marcus four years ago.

Attorney Derek St. Pierre, who was at the protest as a legal observer for
the National Lawyers Guild, sued The City, claiming that three officers
falsely arrested him and used excessive force during a clash between cops
and demonstrators at the Jan. 16, 2000 rally.

Police were called to the upscale Dallas-based department store on
Stockton Street after protesters from the Animal Liberation Front, as well
as other groups, locked themselves to the store with cast-iron pipes, wire
and duct tape. The protest came at a time of frequent clashes between cops
and anti-fur demonstrators, who were accused of smashing the store's
windows and who regularly picketed the store with "fur is murder" signs.
