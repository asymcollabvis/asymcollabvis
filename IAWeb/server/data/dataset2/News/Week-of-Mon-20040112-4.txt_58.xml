  <content>The initial inquiry into the work of the Humane Society 
of Hamilton County shows no dissatisfaction among officials in communities 
served by the animal shelter.
"The ones I've talked with have had no problem or rejections," said Fred 
Swift, administrative assistant to the Hamilton County Commissioners.
Swift has been directed by the commissioners to determine whether the 
nonprofit agency is meeting terms of its contract to shelter stray and unwanted pets 
brought in by animal control officers.
The directive came Monday, as commissioners addressed the shelter's contract 
for 2004 and a complaint of mismanagement by the organization's former public 
relations coordinator.
Commissioners agreed to sign the contract, which could pay up to $293,000 
this year, but they also sought assurances that the agency had met its 
obligations.</content>
