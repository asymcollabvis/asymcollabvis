A new rule from Clayton County Animal Control that is designed to raise more 
money is drawing fire from the local Humane Society and the Animal Control 
Advisory Board.

Animal Control recently instituted a new rule that representatives from 
rescue groups, like the Humane Society, must wait an additional two days to adopt a 
stray animal. Before, the groups could adopt the pets after three days, like 
any other member of the public. 

But rescue groups do not pay an adoption fee, and Animal Control was hoping 
to give the the public a chance to adopt the animal first, so it wouldn't miss 
out on collecting the fees.

Representatives of rescue groups, at the Animal Control Advisory Board 
meeting Monday night, took issue with the new rule.

"It made no sense to extend the period of time the animals are held," said 
Michelle Bryant, president of the Clayton County Humane Society.

Bryant said she worried about the health of animals in the care of Animal 
Control because of the shelter's level of cleanliness and its overcrowding. She 
said she witnessed workers sanitizing dog cages with bleach and not sanitizing 
water and food dishes when the dogs were moved.</content>
