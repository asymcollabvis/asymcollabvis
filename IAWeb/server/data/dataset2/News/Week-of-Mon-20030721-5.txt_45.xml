UBS AG is helping Athens control an army of 4,000 stray dogs as the Greek
capital spruces up before holding the 2004 summer Olympics.

UBS, Europe's biggest bank, and Agricultural Bank of Greece have organized
180 million euros ($206 million) in loans for Athens to finance a series
of clean-up measures, including rounding up and sterilizing a canine
population that officials say is out of control.

"We're trying to offer our best hospitality to our visitors and citizens,"
said Athens Deputy Mayor Theodore Skylakakis in an interview. "The dogs
are a nuisance."
...
The number of dogs roaming Athens may be as high as 150,000, said Neil
Trent, executive director of the Gaithersburg, Maryland- based Humane
Society International. That's because many Greeks are "happy to allow
their pets to wander around the streets," he said.
...
Animal rights groups and individuals from Singapore to Belgium sent
petitions to local and national government officials, prompting the
introduction of an animal welfare law that's considered one of the
toughest in the world, according to Carol McBeth, the director of the
Greek Animal Welfare fund.

"They were inundated with e-mail from people concerned about locking up
and poisoning animals," said McBeth, whose group was established in 1959.
The fund is a member of a coalition of 26 animal welfare associations that
are working with the government.

Athens now plans to build shelters to hold ownerless pooches, which will
be sterilized and vaccinated before being released back onto streets or
into parks if not claimed within a few days. Under the animal welfare law
passed by parliament this month, owners will be required to register and
microchip their dogs and will be prosecuted if found abandoning or abusing
their pets.

Cats are not covered by the new legislation.
