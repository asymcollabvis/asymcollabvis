  <content>This is the tenth in a series of stories on the Pelican Man's 
Bird Sanctuary in Sarasota. 
An arrest warrant has been issued for Mel Beall, former Pelican Man's Bird 
Sanctuary clinic manager. 
The warrant charges Beall, 45, with obtaining a controlled substance by 
fraud. His present whereabouts are unknown, authorities said. 
Beall has been at the center of a firestorm of allegations made by former 
employees that he mismanaged the clinic and abused animals. 
In April, Beall was hospitalized under the Baker Act after he was found lying 
near outside the clinic with a bottle of an unknown substance nearby. The 
Baker Act allows authorities to hold a person for up to 72 hours if they think 
the individual will harm himself or others. 
Beall was also charged recently by the Florida Department of Business and 
Professional Regulation with practicing veterinary medicine without a license. 
Multi-agency probe
