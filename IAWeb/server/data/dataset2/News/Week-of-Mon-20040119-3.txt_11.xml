By Mayo Clinic staff Are you considering a vegetarian diet but not sure where 
to begin? Adopting a plant-based diet may be as easy as making a few 
substitutions. Before you know it, tofu dogs, black bean burgers and sausage made from 
textured vegetable protein may replace old favorites such as hot dogs, 
hamburgers, roast beef and bacon.
Some people choose a vegetarian diet for religious, ethical or environmental 
reasons. Others switch to a plant-based diet for health reasons. A vegetarian 
diet generally contains less total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol and 
includes more dietary fiber. And vegetarians have lower rates of some cancers, 
cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.
Adopting a healthy vegetarian diet isn't as simple as scraping meat off your 
plate and eating what's left. Find out what you need to know about a 
plant-based diet and how you can meet your daily nutritional needs.
