With temperatures averaging about 10 degrees colder than last year, wildlife 
and feral cats are having a tougher time making it through the winter.
The Animal Rescue Fund of the Hamptons has put out a request for donations of 
doghouses to use as shelters for the local feral cat population. ?With this 
tough winter, it?s been very hard on non-native, as well as native species who 
aren?t used to adapting to this weather,? said Sara Davison, Executive 
Director of ARF. ?Feral cats develop winter coats, and are resourceful, but some 
places have risks associated with them, like cars they may sleep under.? She said 
her group monitors 600 wildcat colonies from Westhampton to Montauk, with its 
Operation Cat program, which provides the cats with food and shelter. ?We 
also urge people to bring their domestic pets inside in this weather, but if they 
use dog houses, they need to use straw or hay, which doesn?t freeze, instead 
of blankets, which get wet and freeze.? She said outdoor dogs and cats also 
need more food in colder weather.</content>
