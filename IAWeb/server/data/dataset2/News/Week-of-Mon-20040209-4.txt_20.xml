Despite a downturn in the consumption of horsemeat in France, animal welfare 
organisations protest that as many as 850 horses are still eaten each day 
Recent figures showing that the consumption of horsemeat in France has 
decreased hugely over the last two years have failed to pacify horse welfare 
organisations.

The consumption of horsemeat in France was down by 17% in 2002, and slumped a 
further 10% in 2003. There are less than 1,000 horse butchers in the country, 
falling from 1,300 such specialist outlets in 1999.

The decrease in horsemeat consumption in France is considered to be as a 
result of health concerns. Although many people turned to horsemeat during the BSE 
crisis in the late 90s, on the advice of a government veterinary committee, 
horsemeat is now banned from restaurants throughout the country.

But the Ethical Association of the Horse, a welfare organisation which has a 
range of mottos all enforcing the view that a horse ought not to be eaten, 
maintains that as many as 850 horses are still eaten each day in France (as many 
as 310,000 every year).

The association says that the status of the horse has changed and that he has 
become a companion rather than a slave.</content>
