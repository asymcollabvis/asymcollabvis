More rabbits than Elmer Fudd could handle make their home at three Galt
mobile home parks, and residents there don't know what to do about it.

"Boy was it overwhelming, I'll tell you that," said Katie Peralta, an
officer with the Sacramento chapter of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, after she visited the mobile home park about a month
ago. "The sheer numbers are just amazing."

And that's especially true early in the morning before the summer heat
sets in and after 7 p.m., when there is plenty of shade for the rabbits
to enjoy.

DeAnda disputed Colleton's contention that brown cottontails at Galt
Mobile Estates are legally protected by Fish and Game, saying that
cottontails are not an endangered or threatened species.

"They are game animals," DeAnda said. In fact, rabbit season opened
Thursday, he said.

In Sacramento, a Southern California assemblyman has authored
legislation that would allow landowners to control cottontail and brush
rabbits who eat or damage landscaping.

Assembly Bill 2875, authored by Assemblyman John Benoit, R-Palm Desert,
has been approved by the Assembly. The Senate Natural Resources and
Wildlife Committee deadlocked 4-4 on the bill on Tuesday, but voted to
allow reconsideration at a later date. State Sen. Rico Oller, R-San
Andreas, whose district includes Galt, voted in favor of the bill. Oller
is the committee's vice chairman.
