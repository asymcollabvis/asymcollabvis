  Kelly Savoy is back at the scene of an crime. 

The Humane Society investigator holds one of the survivors, a mixed-breed 
blue heeler puppy named Lucky, in her arms.

Last week, Savoy and other animal rescue workers found the puppy trapped in 
an abandoned house inside a pet carrier. When it was freed from its cage, Lucky 
could barely walk to freedom.

Twelve dogs and nine cats weren?t as lucky when Crowley animal control 
officers arrived at the 100 block of McMullin Street. The other animals were so 
malnourished and parasite-infested that they were euthanized. 

Pictures captured that day show dogs with rib cages visible under skin barely 
covered with patches of fur.

Shari and Ernie Pedigo were arrested and charged with 21 counts of cruelty to 
animals. More cruelty charges are pending against the couple because rabbits 
and ducks were found on a return visit to the property.

The case is still under investigation.

The couple had 12 dogs, nine cats, 29 rabbits and five ducks. Two of the 
rabbits were dead. Two rabbits living in a cage with the rotting carcasses had to 
be euthanized because they were diseased. 

The ducks were so malnourished that they had lost their feathers. Some of the 
dogs and cats stayed inside a trailer on the property with the couple, while 
the rest were outside or in the abandoned house.

Last week, the scene in the yard of the McMullin trailer and an adjacent 
abandoned house was tough, said Janet Lyons, another Humane Society investigator. 

The yard was filled with feces and animal carcasses, Lyons said. 

?I had garbage bags tied at my knees and wore gloves,? she said.
