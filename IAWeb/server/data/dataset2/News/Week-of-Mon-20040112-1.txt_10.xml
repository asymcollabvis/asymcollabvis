USDA Secretary Ann Veneman, last week, listed a national animal
identification program as a major USDA policy priority for mad cow disease
prevention.

USDA has worked with federal and state governments, and with the
food-animal industry for the past 18 months toward the adoption of a
verifiable nationwide animal identification system, says Veneman. The
point is to help enhance the speed and accuracy of the United States?
response to disease outbreaks across many different animal species. "I
have asked USDA's Chief Information Officer to expedite the development of
the technology architecture to implement this (identification) system as a
top priority," she adds. 
...
Implementation of USAIP is scheduled to occur in three phases:

    *
      Phase I, involves premises identification, and is set to begin by
July. This phase would require establishing standardized premises
identification numbers for all U.S. production operations, markets,
assembly points, exhibitions and processing plants.
    *
      Phase II, would enable individual animal or group/lot identification
for interstate and intrastate commerce.
    *
      Phase III, involves retrofitting remaining processing plants and
markets and other industry segments with appropriate technology to enhance
traceability of animals throughout the livestock marketing system.

If the Bush Administration gives priority to the USAIP, bureaucratic
obstacles will be fewer, Slack predicts. "The other big question is money.
Who's going to pay for it? Secretary Veneman says this is needed to
protect public health. It's logical that tax dollars be spent to set up a
world class system," he contends.</content>
