When lawmakers called for better beef labeling last month after mad-cow
disease was found in the U.S., the American Meat Institute complained they
were piling costs on a financially beleaguered beef industry.

A few weeks later, a plan for meat packers to help cover inspection costs
drew another woe-filled response from J. Patrick Boyle, president of the
trade group, who said "farmers, producers and processors are reeling from
the economic impact" of mad-cow disease.

But two months after bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was found in a
cow in Yakima County, it appears the beef industry isn't really "reeling." 
...
To be sure, mad-cow disease is costing money. Dairy farmers and cattle
growers saw the value of animals older than 30 months plunge and stay down
because those are most at risk for the disease.

Beef processors ? as slaughterhouses and meat packers are known ? have
laid off about 1,000 workers to reduce costs and slow production in
response to lost exports. Certain beef cuts and "specialty meats" such as
eyeballs, tongues and intestines no longer bring premium prices in Asia.
Instead, they're ground into hamburger or sent for rendering. Some
processors are still grappling with meat stranded on ships and in foreign
ports when BSE was discovered. 
...
Mad cow couldn't have struck at a better time, as far as the industry's
ability to handle the blow. Producers and processors, which churned out 26
billion pounds of product last year, had raked in record profits, unusual
for a sector given to relatively staid business cycles.</content>
