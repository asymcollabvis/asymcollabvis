  <content>When the first case of mad cow disease surfaced
in the United States three weeks ago, the biggest problem wasn't finding
facts on the cattle brain destroying disease, but sorting through a jumble
of Web sites overflowing with information.

Consumers, trade groups and even local governments flocked to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Web site on bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) (http://www.fas.usda.gov/dlp/BSE/bse.html), calling it by far the
best resource on the Web.

"The USDA Web site is the best place for information," said Kiran
Kernellu, communications manager for the National Meat Association.
...
While there is no shortage of Web sites offering information about Mad Cow
disease, other sites by consumer rights advocates, animal rights activists
and vegetarians have also sprung up to promote their own causes.

The Organic Consumers Association Web site
(http://www.organicconsumers.org/madcow.htm) provides articles and
commentary on Mad Cow disease, along with a petition form for stricter
standards for beef entering the food supply.

People for the Ethical Treat of animals (PETA) also has a Web site
(http://www.peta.org/feat/madcowus/) called "It's Mad to Eat Meat"
offering links ot vegetarian resources as well.

In retaliation, the Web site of The Center For Consumer Freedom
(http://www.madcowscare.com) argues that consumer fears are being fueled
by "scaremongers" who are trying to capitalize on the outbreak.</content>
