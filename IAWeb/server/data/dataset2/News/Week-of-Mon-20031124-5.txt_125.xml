Our son, Sam, and his fianc?e, Jennifer Felt, negotiated nine hours of
traffic last week driving up from D.C. for Thanksgiving, but for Jen the
journey was decidedly longer and viscerally more distressing. On the
occasion of a feast, she came fresh from the slaughter.

She works for the Humane Society International, the global arm of the
Humane Society of the United States. Headquarters are in the nation's
capital. She is program manager for all of Latin America and the Caribbean.

In the two years she's worked for the privately funded organization, it's
simpler to name the few countries to which she has not been sent: Ecuador,
Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. She deals with four principal concerns:
Illegal trade of wildlife; humane methods of stray/street animal control;
working equine welfare, and the economic benefits of humane slaughter.
...
On Tuesday, she was taken to the slaughterhouse outside London, met with a
veterinarian and inspectors on the premises and changed into rubber boots,
two pair of overalls, a hair net and hard hat. She was not given gloves or
goggles. She'd been told she'd kill a minimum of three steers.
...
?Everyone tried to calm me,? she said. ?You just want to do it right.
Otherwise the animal would suffer.? She did it right. That's what the head
slaughterer told her after the first shot. ?I just wanted to get it over
with,? she said. ?I told myself that by doing this I was helping alleviate
the suffering of thousands of animals.?</content>
