  <content>yoming legislators reacted in anger and frustration Thursday as they told 
visiting federal officials the state?s wolf management plan was being held 
hostage to cater to special interest groups. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service notified the Wyoming government on Tuesday 
that wolves would not be removed from the Endangered Species Act list until 
Wyoming amends its current wolf management plan. 
The federal government wants the classification of wolves changed from ?
predatory animals? to ?trophy game.? 
But treating wolves like predators is at the heart of Wyoming?s current plan, 
which allows residents in most of the state to kill wolves on sight. 
Only wolves in northwest Wyoming would be classified as trophy animals, 
subject to the same hunting regulations that apply to mountain lions and bears ? a 
hunting license would be needed. 
The federal government wants the same definition to now extend to the rest of 
the state.</content>
