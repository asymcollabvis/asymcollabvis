Veterinarians yesterday cast doubt over a recent speculation that a growing 
number of dogs died of renal failure because they all ate the same dog food 
made by a well-known international company. 
Rumor is rife on the Internet that this particular brand of dog food contains 
too much salt and therefore causes terminal kidney diseases among dogs. Local 
media reported on the matter following a meeting at the Taoyuan County 
Veterinarians Association earlier this week. 
Chang Tsung-ming, secretary-general of the association, said members of his 
association have recently reported a rising number of renal failure cases but 
stressed that more research is needed before drawing any conclusion. 
These dogs typically developed symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and 
difficulties in urination, according to Chang. 
He has requested the 83 affiliated veterinarian hospitals to gather relevant 
diagnoses and data before the next member meeting, which has been moved ahead 
to early March. 
Josephine Chen, a spokeswoman for the dog food maker, refuted the allegation 
by saying that SGS testing showed a sodium chloride level of 0.34 percent in 
the dog food, which is far lower than the international standard of three 
percent. 
"Our products are marketed in over 120 countries around the globe and we have 
never discovered similar incidents," she said, adding that the isolated cases 
in Taiwan should be subject to further testing. </content>
