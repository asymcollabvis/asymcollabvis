If doctors had to identify the deadliest sin affecting Americans today,
they would probably name gluttony as the No. 1 killer. As obesity in the
United States reaches epidemic proportions, with more than 60 percent of
adults weighing in as overweight or obese, public policy makers and health
officials are scrambling over ways to improve the American diet.

But Dr. Don Colbert, physician and nutritionist, thinks the obesity crisis
could be solved if Americans would pause before inhaling a super-sized
fast food meal and ask themselves a simple question: "Would Jesus eat this?"
...
And Colbert's not the only Christian diet guru urging people to ask what
Jesus would eat. Christian advocates of vegetarianism say if Jesus were
alive today, he would maintain a plant-based diet out of compassion for
animals. Others say Jesus would probably approve of genetically modified
food, given his propensity for transforming and multiplying food. "He was
clearly not against the need to alter and change food," said Arthur
Caplan, chair of the department of medical ethics at the University of
Pennsylvania, referring to Jesus' tranformation of water into wine and his
multiplying the loaves and fishes.
