It's a testament to the optimism of memory that I've forgotten how my bedroom 
smelled after a bad night or how it felt to carry Lydia up and down stairs 
when the elevators weren't working during the blackout last summer or how much 
those vet visits ended up costing. I miss her. Her absence has punched a hole 
in my world. The span of her life took in a marriage, the birth of my son and 
two moves. I wrote and published five books, and dozens of columns and articles 
with Lydia under the desk. When we bought her at a kennel in upstate New York 
and named her Lydia Littledog, I promised her breeder I was going to move to 
the country soon. I never got around to that.

I don't even know how to grieve a person's death. I haven't visited my 
father's grave in years. I tell myself that other ways in which I remember him - 
talking about him and writing about him - are more important. I used to say that 
of Elisabeth K?bler-Ross' famous stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, 
depression and acceptance - I seemed to be stuck in the first two stages.

A lot of grief is the fear of unanswerable questions. Are the dead still with 
us somehow, as they often seem to be? Or are mind and soul trapped in the 
body? Are my father and Lydia up in heaven, taking one of the long walks through 
the birchy New Hampshire woods they both loved? Is he talking to her about his 
work, and is she looking back at him with her doggy disdain for human 
worries? He would have a dog biscuit in the pocket of his frayed chinos and stop to 
give Lydia's soft head a reassuring pat.

"It's OK, girl," he would say. "We'll be home soon."</content>
