Research funded by drug companies is more likely to produce results that 
favour the sponsor's product, reveals a new study.

Researchers analysed 30 previous reports examining pharmaceutical 
industry-backed research and found the conclusions of such research were 
four times more likely to be positive than research backed by other 
sponsors. "What we found was that in almost all cases there was a bias - a 
rather heavy bias - in favour [of a drug] when the study was industry 
funded," study leader Joel Lexchin told New Scientist. The main reasons for 
this, say the team, may be that positive studies are more likely to be 
published than negative ones. Also, inappropriate comparison drugs may be 
used in these trials, skewing findings in favour of the tested product. The 
new analysis is published in a special issue of the British Medical Journal, 
which focuses on the close relationship between doctors and the 
pharmaceutical industry.
