The tradition of dog hunting in North Florida clashes with growing
development. Frustrated property owners want to ban the sport on private
land that once was open.
...
MARIANNA - John Daniel loves everything about his 800-acre property: the
cabin overlooking a tranquil pond, the wild turkeys scampering in the
brush, the whoosh of wind through the tall pine trees.

But Daniel dreads deer hunting season.

From October to February each year, the calm is shattered by barking
hounds chasing deer through Daniel's property and hunters tearing up and
down nearby roads in noisy trucks.

Like dozens of North Florida land owners, Daniel has complained to law
enforcement and state wildlife officers about the dogs and the hunters who
chase them.

But Daniel and other property owners say their complaints made them
targets of retribution, threats and even arson. Some even say that deer
innards are left in their driveways.

They blame dog hunters.

"They don't care about other people's property rights," said Daniel, who
says his home burned just days after pressing charges against a dog hunter
in 2001. "They need to leave us alone. I've had enough."
