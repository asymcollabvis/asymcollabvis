Brace yourselves, Southern fried chicken lovers.

This is going to shock you, but according to People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, innocent yard birds are being slaughtered in the
name of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

That's right.

Every finger-licking morsel of Original or Extra Crispy contains a piece
of dead chicken. 
...
All of this leads me to wonder what kind of chicken that PETA wants KFC
to serve. After all, there are only two kinds: dead and alive.

I can't speak for you, but I prefer my chicken dead.

If KFC served live chickens, we'd all be chasing them around the
restaurant with a fork and a knife. That would be even more stressful
and cruel for the chickens. Feathers and who-knows-what would be
everywhere, which would probably violate some kind of health codes.

"KFC stands for cruelty in our book," says PETA Director of Vegan
Campaigns Bruce Friedrich. "If Yum! executives treated cats or dogs the
way they treat chickens, they could go to prison on felony
cruelty-to-animals charges."

Get a grip, PETA.
