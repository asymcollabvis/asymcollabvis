A dog is there for the taking. He can't talk back. He can't say, stop,
you're killing me, you're treating me like a dog. Six years ago, Margery
Glickman happened upon a couple of hundred dogs that, if they could have
spoken, would have said just that.

Glickman was vacationing in Alaska. She came for the scenery but saw
instead a "dog farm." Animals were tethered to stakes by chains,
belligerent in their confinement, drinking filthy water, sitting, as she
said, "in their own fecal matter." This was a breeding place for the
Iditarod. Glickman was perplexed.

Even back home in Miami, Glickman had heard of the Iditarod. It was a
1,149-mile dog sled race in the middle of winter across Alaska. Designed
to commemorate the diphtheria run that saved lives in 1925, the Iditarod
had become romantic legend, courageous mushers crossing forests, rivers,
tundra and mountain ranges with enthusiastic canines. What glory! Ah, but
where was the glory in this?

"I was appalled," she said.

Glickman had never been an activist in her life. She was a first-grade
teacher. She was a mom. She was in Alaska to relax. Problem was, she couldn't.
...
The Iditarod is a money-maker. Glickman, 56, has launched Sled Dog Action
Coalition, a nonprofit volunteer-only organization. She has been so
successful, sponsors like Pizza Hut, Pfizer and Costco have dropped out.
She has received death threats, enough of them so that she doesn't go to
Alaska.

"It is unconscionable," Glickman said. "They (mushers) say they love their
dogs, but they don't love their dogs. It is an act of barbarism. It is a
shameless, bloody business."</content>
