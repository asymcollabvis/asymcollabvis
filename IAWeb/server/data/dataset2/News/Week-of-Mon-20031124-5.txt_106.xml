It's holiday shopping time. Our mailboxes and newspapers are filled with low 
prices on gifts we just cannot pass up. Your task this year is to make sure 
the gifts you give, along with their packaging, are green.

When we buy gifts, we need to look at their life and usefulness. Would we 
want to hang onto a gift for 50 years?

Americans produce 25 percent more trash between Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
About 40 percent of holiday gifts received are on their way to the landfill 
within a month of the holidays. So take a minute and think green.

Electronics are generally cheaper the weeks before Christmas. The big 
question is what to do with the old electronic items. Before leaving office, Gov. 
Davis finally signed into law Senate Bill 20, which is the electronics recycling 
bill. Unfortunately, it will initially cover only TV and computer monitors, 
and those recycling programs won't kick in until late next year.

The good news is that Vallejo Garbage Service (VGS) will have an electronics 
recycling event in late spring 2004. In the interim, VGS will pick up TV and 
computer monitors for a fee or you can safely store your old devices until the 
event.

Shopping locally for your holiday gifts saves energy and time and keeps tax 
money in our city's coffers. Check out the new stores downtown when you go to 
Saturday's farmers market. Walk up Marin Street to the Museum Bookstore for 
local books or gift memberships and continue on to the Vallejo Artists Guild 
Gallery for paintings from local artists.

On that same theme, make a donation in a friend's name to the local Friends 
of Animals or Humane Society. This gift will help abandoned dogs and cats and 
is a waste-free gift for the receiver.</content>
