If Debra Poneman could give parents one word of advice about a newly
vegetarian kid - well, it would be two words, but both would be most
welcome.

"Stop worrying" said the Evanston mother of two and author of What? No
Meat? What to Do When Your Kid Becomes a Vegetarian (ECW Press, 2003).

Poneman remembers well her mother's reaction when she, then a
17-year-old Skokie girl, announced her decision to renounce meat. "Mom
said, without missing a beat, 'That's nice, but Daddy has some skirt
steaks on the grill, so why don't you wait and start tomorrow?' "

"Well, I started 'tomorrow,' and now it's been 35 years," Poneman said,
laughing, in a recent interview. And although her mother -- like many
parents -- feared for her vegetarian daughter's health, it soon became
apparent there was no need to worry.
