AGAINST a global backdrop of outrage against the abuse of Iraqi prisoners
by American soldiers, another military scandal angered Australians this
week - the victims, four kittens.

The litter of a stray cats was held captive in a residential section of
Lavarack Barracks in Townsville during an Easter Saturday drinking session
involving six members of an army support battalion.

One kitten was dragged behind a motorcycle on a rope and then crushed
under the tyre of a 4WD vehicle, while the others were doused with fuel
and set alight.

Talkback radio lines ran hot and letters to the editor baskets filled up
with angry demands for the six Townsville-based servicemen to be
discharged from the Australian Army.
