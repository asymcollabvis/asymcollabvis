  <content>New Jersey health officials Friday will
likely rule out any connection between 17 human deaths and mad cow
disease, UPI has learned.

The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services will present their
final report on an investigation into the deaths that prompted fears of a
mad cow disease connection, but the indications are that authorities have
ruled out any link to tainted meat, said Llelwyn Grant, spokesman for the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which assisted in the
investigation.
