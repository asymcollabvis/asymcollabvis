They?re in pigs, ducks, sheep, cows, horses and birds.

And they?re in your cat, lazily curled on the part of the sofa where you
sometimes lay your head. And in your dog, who joyfully slobbers hello when
you come into the house.

Viruses. Parasites. Bacteria. Fungi.

Jumping from animals to people over time, animal-based germs and organisms
have helped create the diseases that have caused the most human deaths in
history.

Blame cattle, pigs, insects and birds for measles, tuberculosis, bubonic
plague, smallpox, influenza, whooping cough, cholera and malaria.

Previously undiagnosed diseases have proliferated in recent years because
of rapid global travel and the worldwide shipping of food, imported exotic
pets that carry diseases previously unknown to certain areas, growing
populations encroaching on formerly pristine areas and development of the
scientific and technological ability to identify the diseases. 
...
Add to that the centralized nature of animal processing plants and poor
conditions on some poultry farms, and you have the potential for a
disaster to spread as rapidly as possible, said Bruce Friedrich, a
spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

?We cram chickens together,? he said. ?A shed with 20,000 birds and each
bird with less space than a standard piece of paper, cooped up in their
own feces and urine in badly ventilated sheds. It?s a wonder that things
aren?t significantly worse.?

But one expert said criticisms that factories are unsanitary and depend
too much on injecting animals with drugs have been exaggerated. </content>
