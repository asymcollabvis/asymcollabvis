The San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously agreed with 
city zoo officials and animal rights activists that the two elephants remaining 
in local captivity should be moved to a sanctuary. 
So why are zoo officials and animal rights activists still at odds over the 
fate of the elephants? 
It seems it's a matter of timing. Zoo officials say they need to examine 
information submitted by two sanctuaries -- one in California and another in 
Tennessee -- and prepare the pachyderms for the move, which could take two to four 
months. 
But representatives of a group called In Defense of Animals say that's just a 
delaying tactic, and that the elephants should be moved immediately -- before 
zoo officials have a chance to bow down to opposition from the zoo's 
accrediting organization, which wants the animals sent to another one of its member 
facilities. 
Meanwhile, the supervisors -- without discussion -- on Tuesday came down on 
the activists' side and passed a nonbinding resolution urging the zoo to 
immediately bring in representatives from the Performing Animal Welfare Society, 
located in San Andreas, Calaveras County, and begin the transfer. 
The ballyhoo began after the deaths this spring of elephants Calle, 37, who 
suffered from degenerative joint disease, and Maybelle, who died of heart 
failure at age 43. According to zoo spokeswoman Nancy Chan, Maybelle was one of the 
three oldest elephants in captivity at the time of her demise.
