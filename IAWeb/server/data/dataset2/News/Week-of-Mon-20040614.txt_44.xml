ATHENS, Ga. -- A University of Georgia fraternity member who is accused
of killing a raccoon with a pellet gun has withdrawn two motions aimed
at having an animal cruelty charge against him dropped.

Erik Robert Zimmerman, 20, of Marble, N.C., was arrested after a Dec. 12
incident in which he used a pellet gun to shoot and kill a raccoon that
was behaving erratically.

Another member of Zimmerman's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity skinned the
animal and another cooked and ate the raccoon's meat. The other students
involved in the incident - fraternity members Patrick Perry and Ivan
Garcia - do not face criminal charges because they did not participate
in killing the raccoon.
