As far as anyone can tell, the biggest threat from the world's first 
transgenic pet might be that it keeps a few goldfish awake at night. 
But for opponents of transforming animals through bioengineering, the red 
glow emanating from the new GloFish might as well be a five-alarm fire. 
Because the US government quickly agreed the fish was safe, concern is 
spreading that regulatory oversight of transgenic animals may be flawed.
A long line of genetically modified animals are under study: flea-resistant 
dogs, cats with nonallergenic fur, and designer mosquitoes that could outbreed 
the current pests but would be incapable of carrying diseases such as malaria. 
Thus, the tiny and innocuous GloFish has plunged the scientific and 
regulatory communities into murky waters.
