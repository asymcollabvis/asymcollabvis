The animals mentioned in this column are available for adoption at their 
respective animal shelters. These shelters do not euthanize unless the animal has 
a contagious or terminal disease.
These animals are all healthy, and have been selected by the managers of the 
shelters as animals who would make ideal pets for certain individuals. Because 
many people prefer puppies or kittens, it is the adult animals who have a 
more difficult time finding homes, and are at risk of spending long periods of 
time, if not their entire lives in a shelter. 

SOUTH KINGSTOWN POUND currently 1 dog and 1 cat available at the pound and 
there are many cats and kittens available at PETsMART on Route 2, Warwick. For 
more information about adopting a pet at the pound, call  or visit 
their website .

Like the beloved bear Baloo from Disney's Jungle Book, Bubba, a 2-year-old 
German Shepherd/Golden Retriever mix, is somewhat like an elephant in a china 
closet.
Reardon described the black and auburn 2-year-old as a "big boy who is sweet."
But Bubba, who was brought to the pound back in December, doesn't realize 
just how big he is. 
Reardon said that sometimes when he's playing fetch, his favorite game, he'll 
bump into people. 
Because of Bubba's size Reardon thinks he'd do best in a household without 
small children. </content>
