It's a place where orphaned and abandoned cats roam free, sunning themselves 
in the windowsill and lounging on cat furniture until just the right adoptive 
family arrives to take them home. 
If you haven't visited Heartland Animal Rescue Team in Brainerd lately, the 
newly renovated cat room may surprise you. 
The rows of individual cat cages are gone, along with the multitude of litter 
boxes. Instead, for the past three months the cats and kittens now available 
for adoption in the animal shelter are allowed to freely roam the cat room, an 
open and sunny place filled with handmade cat furniture, a couch and a couple 
of discreetly placed litter boxes. Cat toys can be found throughout the room 
as the cats entertain themselves or snuggle up to visitors. 
The renovations reflect a change in philosophy at the animal shelter. 
Kennel manager Adriene Myears has been at HART for five months. She said she 
arrived at the shelter with several goals in mind. Included in those goals was 
to increase the rate of cat adoptions and help the adoptive cats become 
better equipped to deal with a home environment.
