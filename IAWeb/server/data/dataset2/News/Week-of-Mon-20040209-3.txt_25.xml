This story is one of a series looking at National Geographic Crittercam 
research. Crittercam is a research instrument worn by wild animals and equipped 
with a video camera and other information-gathering equipment. (Get the basics on 
underwater and terrestrial Crittercams.) 
For more on this story, tune in to the Crittercam: Leatherback Sea Turtles 
episode on the National Geographic Channel in the U.S. Watch video previews 
online. 
In 1989 some 1,400 leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) heaved 
themselves ashore to nest at Playa Grande beach in Costa Rica's Las Baulas 
National Marine Park. By 1995 the number emerging from the surf to deposit their eggs 
was less than half this number. Last year fewer than 50 females waded on to 
the beach. 
Those shocking figures reflect a worldwide trend?frequently snagged in 
fishing nets, leatherbacks may have declined by as much as 95 percent in the last 
two decades or so. </content>
