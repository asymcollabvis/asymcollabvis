The wannabe Heydukes of the E.L.F most recently claimed responsibility for
$50 million in damage to a California real state development. Apparently
some people in California were trying to replace massive tracts of
untrammeled open space with pavement, heavily-fertilized lawns and
hundreds of rows of nearly identical particle-board houses. Paving
paradise and putting up a parking lot pisses off the people at E.L.F., so
they torched it.

Unfortunately, their extreme methods torched support for their cause, too.

If you?re not aware, these are the same people who claimed responsibility
for several fires on Vail Mountain that caused an estimated $12 million in
damage in October of 1998. Beyond property damage there were losses on a
different level: several priceless photographs of Vail in its early days
were destroyed, and all of the people who lived, worked, skied and
otherwise loved Vail Mountain were devastated and hurt to discover that a
place we considered ours would be attacked and tagged as anti-environmental.

But just like Heyduke and the Gang, the short-sighted people from E.L.F.
are not terrorists.

In an effort to condemn the E.L.F., good ol? U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis,
R-Grand Junction, is trying to elevate E.L.F.?s attacks to the level of
terrorism.

Oh, boy. Here we go again. 
...
There is a major difference between the terrible extremists in Al-Qaeda
and the eco-nerds in E.L.F., and that difference is human life. If human
beings were killed at Two Elk, human beings would now be afraid to enter
Two Elk. We would, as they say, be terrified for our lives.

On a more fundamental level, it is shallow and materialistic to equate the
destruction of property with the destruction of human life. But when it
comes down to it, that?s exactly what McInnis is trying to do.
