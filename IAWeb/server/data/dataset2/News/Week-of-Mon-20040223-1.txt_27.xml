From widespread protein-rich diets to the ongoing mad cow scare to
McDonald's new all-white-meat chicken nuggets, meat -- and the controversy
surrounding it -- has helped shape American nutritional values.

The Atkins "very-low" carbohydrate diet plan has made its mark in fast
food restaurants such as Subway with its "Atkins Friendly" chicken bacon
wrap, in bookstores with a multitude of guidebooks and cookbooks, and in
supermarkets with Atkins brand sugar-free pancake syrup and barbecue sauce.

For some, the decision to eat select meats or refrain from eating meat
altogether has religious or cultural influences.

"(The) Chinese have a traditional notion that foods that are 'warming' in
nature, like meat, are important for building up physical strength; so in
the minds of some of the older generation, one could not possibly get all
the nutrition one needed from the "cool" bean greens, white radishes, and
so forth that vegetarians favor," author Lin Ching Shywan wrote in
"Vegetarian Cooking -- Chinese Style."

Shywan wrote that she became a vegetarian because of her belief in
Buddhism, not because of a healthy lifestyle. She added that many
Buddhists advocate vegetarianism because of their belief in having mercy
for other living creatures.

According to the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, a vegan
diet -- or "pure vegetarian" diet -- offers several nutritional benefits.

"Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate
for all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, infancy,
childhood and adolescence," the June 2003 article said. "Vegetarian diets
offer a number of nutritional benefits, including lower levels of
saturated fat and cholesterol."
