CNN.comThe U.S. House of Representatives Thursday rejected 
an attempt to ban snowmobiles from Yellowstone National Park, which critics say 
cause pollution and disturb wildlife.
The House voted 224-198 against the ban, originally pushed by the Clinton 
administration. The Bush administration decided to allow the machines to stay in 
the park, most of which is in Wyoming.
"If there's something not natural in a national park, it's snowmobiles," said 
Rep. Sam Farr, a California Democrat who supported barring the vehicles.
Opponents of the ban said concerns about the impact on the park's environment 
and wildlife could be addressed by requiring the use of cleaner, quieter 
snowmobiles and limiting the number allowed in daily.
