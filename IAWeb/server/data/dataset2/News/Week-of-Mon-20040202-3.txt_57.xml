The independent inquiry found that Hall had seriously deviated from commonly 
accepted scientific practices. A similar finding was made in allegation three 
that the committee considered, yet no mention was made of this by the 
vice-chancellor.
Nor does he mention allegation five, which actually emerged during the course 
of the inquiry. While the inquiry made no adverse finding, the members 
uncovered damaging information - major problems with the way Hall changed his 
interpretation of data to suit different circumstances. This occurred in a paper and 
an abstract and it concerns the definition of rejection. In one situation in 
defending the findings of an abstract to a conference, Hall interprets the 
results from a group of rats as rejection but, in another situation, a paper 
submitted for publication, he interprets the same data from the same rats as 
tolerance, not rejection.
In relation to the other allegations concerning missing data and the alleged 
misrepresentation of data and statistics in a grant application to the NHMRC, 
the Brennan inquiry found Hall had committed a significant falsehood, had 
acted with reckless disregard for the truth or with intent to deceive. Hume 
partially disagreed with the inquiry, relying on reasons which were very similar to 
the explanations given by Hall to the inquiry.</content>
