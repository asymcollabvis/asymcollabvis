 Woodbine fire leaves 31 horses dead
 $3 million blaze sweeps massive racetrack barn
 
 
 Thirty-one thoroughbred racehorses are dead after raging flames engulfed a
 massive horse barn complex at Woodbine Racetrack in the early morning
 darkness yesterday.
 
 Scores more horses bolted the inferno. And as the $3 million fire ? the
 second to hit the same complex in 12 years ? quickly turned the
 northwestern Etobicoke track into a sea of chaos, frantic grooms and
 trainers struggled to herd the panicked animals to safety.
 
 "All I thought was I had to care for my animals," said groom Ernest
 Tambwe, who risked his life to free 56 horses from the flames. Tambwe, who
 was being treated for smoke inhalation in hospital after his ordeal, said
 he never paused to think of his own safety.
 
 "I was hired to look after the horses and that's what I did," the 38-year-
 old said, speaking through an oxygen mask.
 
 Woodbine officials said today that 29 horses had died in the fire. Five
 injured horses were sent to the Ontario Veterinary Hospital in Guelph,
 where two more died.ws.org
