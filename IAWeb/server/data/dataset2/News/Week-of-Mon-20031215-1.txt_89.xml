On a cool, rainy afternoon, inside Philadelphia?s Wachovia Center,
children and parents crowd the cavernous hall trying to get a closer look
at Asia, the elephant who paints with her trunk. Asia is a star of the
?three-ring adventure? in the 133rd edition of the Ringling
Brothers/Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, the largest and oldest in the U.S. As
families mill about they see posters describing Ringling?s efforts to
protect endangered Asian elephants. The tagline reads: ?Endangered
species? Not if we can help it.?
...
For years, animal rights and welfare groups have been protesting
Ringling?s use of animals, particularly endangered species such as
elephants and tigers. They complain of cruel training, transport and
living conditions, and urge the public to avoid circuses that include
animal acts. Last July, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. handed
animal advocates, including the Fund for Animals and the ASPCA, a legal
victory in their efforts to hold Ringling accountable. The groups?
lawsuit, now moving forward, charges Ringling with violating the
Endangered Species Act by abusing elephants through routine circus
practices (using bullhooks, chaining them for long periods, and weaning
baby elephants too young).

A growing number of cities are banning circuses with animal acts, and
activists are not convinced that Ringling has changed. The lives of
elephants born at the CEC ?will be filled with chains and bullhooks,?
charges Debbie Leahy, director of captive and exotic animals for People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). ?The fact that wild
populations are still dwindling is proof enough that what they?re doing
isn?t doing a darn bit of good.?</content>
