Living with humans for hundreds of generations has altered the cognitive 
abilities of domesticated dogs, according to new research by Harvard University 
anthropologist Brian Hare. He reported these findings in Seattle this week at 
the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
His new work provides direct evidence that dogs' lengthy contact with humans 
has served as a selection factor, leading to distinct evolutionary changes," 
says Hare, who recently completed his Ph.D. in anthropology in Harvard's 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences. "This is the first demonstration that humans play an 
ongoing role in the evolution of canine cognition."

Hare has shown previously that domesticated dogs are far more skillful at 
reading human communicative signals -- such as glances or pointing -- than either 
a close human relative, the chimpanzee, or a close dog relative, the wolf.
Hare's latest research involved New Guinea Singing Dogs, a subspecies that 
shows strong indications of domestication at some time in the past but now 
exists as feral, reclusive individuals in the highlands of New Guinea. These dogs, 
related to dingoes, have gone without significant human contact for at least 
the past 6,000 years, and little is known about their behavior in the wild.</content>
