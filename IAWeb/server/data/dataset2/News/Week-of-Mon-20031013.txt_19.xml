Pair welcome abandoned, threatened animals to farm.
Emma had mistakenly been left in a pile of dead animals. 
And it's true, she was near death. But then she raised her head, and in that 
movement, she caught the attention of an angel.
That's how Emma's saga began. Along the way, the 9-year-old sheep has 
benefited from the compassion of more than one human angel. There was the person who 
rescued her from the pile of dead animals at the slaughterhouse in 
Pennsylvania. There were the people who took her to Farm Sanctuary, a shelter for rescued 
animals in upstate New York, where she was nursed back to health.

And now, she has David Welch and Lynn Alpern, who adopted her and took her to 
live with them, first in Maryland, then finally bringing her with them when 
they moved to this wooded oasis in the foothills.
Caring for this farmful of castoffs and rescuees costs the couple about 
$15,000 a year, not counting the cost of the land and buildings. And because caring 
for so many critters is a full-time job, Alpern stays home. Welch's salary 
must support them all.
"We do get generous donations from grocery stores," Alpern says. "I bring 
home a trunkful of food from Safeway five days a week. It's amazing how much food 
would be thrown out otherwise. But it provides a lot of treats for our birds 
and rabbits."
