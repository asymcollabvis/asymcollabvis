<content>Applause greeted the happy news announced Wednesday to Deschutes 
County commissioners: The Humane Society of Central Oregon has reached its $1 
million fund-raising goal and is about to start construction of a new, 
greatly enlarged shelter for lost, abandoned and abused dogs and cats, replacing its 
cramped, 27-year-old facility.

Kittens and puppies don?t really know how to applaud, of course. But they 
would if they could, since it's their fate and future that will be much more 
hopeful, once the new shelter is completed late this year. 

The city last fall approved the site plan for the $2.4 million shelter, to be 
built beside the current facility on county-donated land along Southeast 27th 
Street, south of the Knott Landfill. Site preparation is expected to begin 
soon, and groundbreaking for the 15,000-square-foot shelter ? nearly three times 
the current size ? is planned in March, said Nancy Stewart, president of the 
humane society (www.hsco.org) board. </content>
