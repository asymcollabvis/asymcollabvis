A cat has been rescued from a building site in Newquay where it was trapped 
under the concrete floor of a partially constructed building. 
The RSPCA was called on Wednesday when visiting Health and Safety inspectors 
heard the cat mewing. 
It is not clear how long the cat had been trapped, but the animal charity 
says he is quite thin and dehydrated. 
Charles Gilby, from the Health and Safety Executive, said the concrete floor 
was laid two months ago. 
 He's probably used up more than one of his nine lives 

Felicity Cross, RSPCA Officer 
Inspectors from the executive have been carrying out construction site visits 
across the county in a bid to reduce the number of fatal and serious injuries 
in the industry.
