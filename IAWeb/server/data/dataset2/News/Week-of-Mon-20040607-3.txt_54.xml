SELF-IMPRESSED protesters who wanted to "shut down" the BIO 2004
conference in San Francisco last week could take a lesson in morality and
courage from Emeryville's Chiron Corp. The protesters engaged in their
cheap stunts knowing there would be no real consequences for their
actions -- not in San Francisco. Chiron employees, on the other hand,
endured personal abuse and vicious harassment for months because they
believe their work to develop new medicines and therapies is too
important to abandon.

The harassment began in 2003, when animal-rights activists began
targeting Chiron because it had contracted with the animal-research firm,
Huntingdon Life Sciences. The campaign -- which included yelling
obscenities in front of workers' homes, following workers' children and
jamming employees' home phone lines -- is the handiwork of Stop
Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, an animal-rights group dedicated to shutting
down Huntingdon for using animals in research.

SHAC's specialty, which has evolved into harassing and intimidating
companies that do business with Huntingdon, is called "tertiary
targeting."
