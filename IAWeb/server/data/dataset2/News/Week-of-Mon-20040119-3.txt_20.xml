Every pet cat, dog and ferret in Cook County would have to be implanted with 
an identifying microchip under a proposal discussed Wednesday by a Cook County 
Board panel. 
The proposed ordinance, sponsored by Commissioner Peter Silvestri of Elmwood 
Park, would mean that some 3 million pets would have to have the implants. 
Other pets, like birds and reptiles, would not be covered by the law. 
Owners who did not comply would face fines of $20 per day, but it's doubtful 
that the county is in any position to enforce the ordinance, considering one 
study showed only a 25 percent compliance rate with the county's existing 
ordinance requiring rabies vaccinations. 
The microchip is about the size of a grain of rice, can be implanted with a 
syringe into the folds of skin on a pet's neck scruff and allows lost pets to 
be readily identified and reunited with their owners, said Dan Parmer, 
administrator of the Cook County Department of Animal and Rabies Control.</content>
