Finally, on Thursday, a whisper of hope. Someone had heard the sound of a 
truck near Bombardopolis, where about 200 children live in the group's orphanage. 
Then, on Friday, Chatman was able to reach a contact in Port-au-Prince who 
had spoken with someone in the village. 

"Everything?" Chatman asked upon hearing the truck had made it. "Praise the 
Lord!" 


Missing for almost a month, the truck and its load of food had been hidden in 
Gonaives as the driver tried to persuade the rebels who held the city to 
allow the shipment through. Finally, the rebel leader relented, even providing 
armed guards to protect the truck from bandits. 

For the missionaries, the shipment represents one of many "miracles" they 
have witnessed, as they face one trial after another during their work in Haiti. 
The rebellion that swept the country during the past month and the sudden 
departure of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide are only the latest challenges. 

Chatman, 63, first visited Haiti in 1975, during a catastrophic drought that 
struck the northwest particularly hard. He only intended to go once, planning 
to focus his evangelist and missionary efforts in India. But he said he felt 
called by God once he saw the conditions in Haiti. 

"I visited villages where people told me they had lost half their families," 
he said. "They had eaten the big animals first, then dogs and cats, then rats 
and bugs. Some of them were eating bark to get by. 

"If you've ever seen that, you'll be changed." </content>
