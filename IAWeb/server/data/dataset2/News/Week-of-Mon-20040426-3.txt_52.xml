A cow at a meatpacking plant was destroyed after it showed signs of having
a central nervous system disorder and will be tested for mad cow disease,
a U.S. Department of Agriculture official said Friday.

USDA spokesman Ed Loyd said the cow was destroyed at a slaughter house
Wednesday and will be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also
known as mad cow disease.

Central nervous system disorder is one of the signs of BSE. Animals
showing any kind of aggressive behavior are destroyed and do not enter the
food supply, Loyd said.

"There are also many reasons an animal would exhibit signs." Loyd said.
"We cannot jump to the conclusion that it has BSE. That's why there's
testing done."
