Security has been tightened on the BOC gas production site in Scunthorpe,
in the wake of protest threats from animal rights activitists.

The 32-acre site on Warren Road - said to be one of the biggest
production centres in Europe - is on a hit list drawn up by protest group
Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac). The Worcestershire-based Shac
campaign is planning a national march and rally in Guildford on June 26
to highlight BOC's alleged involvement with experiments at a top research
laboratory.

Shac spokeswoman Barbara Davis today not did rule out the prospect of
supporters staging a simultaneous protest in Scunthorpe on the same day.

BOC, which has traded in North Lincolnshire for 46 years, supplying gases
to the nearby Corus steelworks, declined to discuss security measures on
the Warren Road site.

But spokeswoman Helen Bray said: "People who are concerned about animal
rights issues have a legitimate right to protest and we support that
right."

She said the company, which has other sites in Grimsby and
Stallingborough, supplied gases to a wide range of businesses, including
Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS).
