Winter in the north-east of Scotland can get very cold indeed. The sea breeze 
coupled with a near Arctic frost often makes you wish that you had a warm and 
toasty layer of fur to keep you that little bit warmer. 
I was still extremely surprised, however, when on Hogmanay a friend of mine 
turned up to meet our group wearing a 1950s style three-quarter length 
rabbit-lined leather coat with warm and luxurious fur trimmings adorning the collar 
and cuffs, abundantly suitable for the cold of the outdoor party we were heading 
for.

Throughout the evening, this rather spectacular item caused a lot of comment, 
from admiration to disgust, but the fact that it was being worn at all was an 
indication of changing attitudes towards fur as a fashion statement. 
For many years wearing fur has been the kind of sartorial political 
incorrectness that would see celebrities blacklisted from fashion pages across the 
land. The use of fur in fashion is an emotive issue in a way that leather is not: 
comparatively few people would think twice about purchasing leather shoes, 
coats and other accessories yet many find the notion of wearing fur quite 
repellent.
