Ten years ago, Humane Society Silicon Valley housed 45,000 animals a year. 
Sadly, less than 15 percent of these animals were placed in loving homes. Most 
were euthanized due to lack of shelter space. Back then, our long-term vision 
was to eliminate the unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable pets at our shelter. 
The good news is this: Adoptable pets are no longer being euthanized at our 
shelter.
Today, fewer unwanted animals are entering our shelter, and more animals than 
ever before are finding homes. Last year, some 27,000 animals came to our 
shelter, 40 percent fewer than 10 years ago. Nearly 7,100, or 99 percent, of our 
adoptable animals found homes -- more than any other animal care facility in 
the Bay Area.
While we have made huge strides, much remains to be done. Last year, we 
euthanized 14,100 animals, and in the Bay Area, 50,000 pets were euthanized. In the 
United States, six to eight million animals are euthanized each year.
Why are so many animals still being euthanized? It isn't because we cannot 
find enough homes for these animals, or that we don't have enough shelter space. 
The real problem is that a majority of these animals are not adoptable. They 
are under-socialized, resulting in excessive shyness, fear and aggression; 
they have a history of biting; they have severe medical problems or they are very 
old.
Focusing only on ``adoptable'' pets trivializes the thousands of animal 
deaths that occur each year in our community. What we really need to ask ourselves 
is this: How did this animal get this way, and how do we reduce the number of 
unwanted, unadoptable animals?
Why should the public care? Because euthanizing unwanted animals is a 
community problem. It is a reflection of our society and how some of us treat other 
living things.</content>
