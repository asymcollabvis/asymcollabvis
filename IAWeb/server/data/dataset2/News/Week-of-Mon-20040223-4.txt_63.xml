Ranchi, Wild elephants in Jharkhand will now have their favourite intoxicant 
placed at their doorstep -- to keep them from plundering human habitations in 
search of the brew! Forest officials in Jharkhand have drawn up a novel plan 
to keep wild elephants at bay with 'mahua', a local brew that the animals are 
known to be partial to. 
The elephants are known for their love of 'mahua', prepared from the flowers 
of a local tree of the same name, and often barge into villages in search of 
the liquor. 
Damage to property is usually extensive during these forays, which often 
result in the loss of lives. 
Last month elephants raided two villages in Dumka and Godda districts to 
drink mahua. They trampled four mahua traders to death and consumed their liquor 
stocks before returning to the forests. 
Taking advantage of the animals' weakness for the brew, the Jharkhand forest 
department has decided to place stocks of mahua near water bodies frequented 
by elephants. 
This, the foresters hope, will help contain the elephants within forests. 
"We have identified 50 water bodies where elephants generally drink water. 
Mahua will be kept near these water bodies to ensure that they do not venture 
into villages in search of the drink," a forest official told IANS. 
According to officials, elephants also enter villages to raid granaries.
