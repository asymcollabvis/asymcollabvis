LOWELL Rose McGarry owns a pet dog and 11 ducks. And she adores filet
mignon too much to be a vegetarian.

But when she ate lunch recently at J.J. Boomers on Pawtucket Boulevard,
she didn't like what she saw.

Near the bar was an arcade-type game featuring a 50-gallon tank with
flashy lighting and sound effects. For $2, a customer can operate a
miniature crane much like the popular stuffed-animal amusement seen in
restaurants and carnivals.
...
Peter Gollub, director of law enforcement at the Massachusetts Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said he hadn't heard of Lobster Zone
and would need details before determining if the game "deserved a closer
look."
...
People for the Ethical Treatment Animals, the radical animal-rights group,
has denounced Lobster Zone as cruel.

"Lobsters aren't stuffed animals," said William Rivas-Rivas, spokesman for
PETA, whose Web site lauds actress Drew Barrymore for her desire to
release all lobsters from holding tanks. "Their pain and fear are real."

A few years ago, PETA jousted verbally with Lobster Zone's inventor, J. R.
Fishman of Florida, who touted his game as "something different" and a
money-maker.
