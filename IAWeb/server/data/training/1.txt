Mike, the richest man in this city, found his vault empty today. There were many servants and a maid at his house. Mike lived in his house and left for work in the morning. When he returned from work he saw that his vault was empty. All the money inside the vault was missing.

Mike gets very upset seeing the vault empty. He thought, “Only I know the password of the vault, so how can anyone open that vault?” Police had come and started the investigation.
