The police investigated that vault very well. During the investigation, he found a nail piece that was long and his suspicion first came upon the maid. Both of them called the maid and said to her, “What is your nail doing near this locker?”

“Forgive me sir. I don’t know how it got here? But I haven’t stolen anything.” The maid folded her hands and told them both.

Other than the nail piece, there is also a smell of soap in the vault which is used to wash the dishes in the kitchen.
