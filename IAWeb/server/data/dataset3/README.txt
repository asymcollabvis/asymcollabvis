The data set you will be looking at represents a new approach to test and evaluation of analytic tools.   Our goal is to provide a synthetic data set with a known threat baseline that can help analytic tool builders better understand how well their tools work in a realistic information environment.  Please note -- this dataset is created to help test how analysis tools work and not how well analysts can perform a task. 

If you have a question about this data set, please contact NVAC at nvac@pnl.gov.  We also would like to request that you do not distribute this data to anyone else, as we hope to have several people look at it in its different incarnations.
